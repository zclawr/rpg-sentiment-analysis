# rpg-sentiment-analysis

Abstract: WIP

- Instead of using big modern dataset (i.e. Twitter Sentiment Analysis), we want to use datasets catered specifically to the roleplay environment we want to enforce in our game.
- We believe that limiting our dataset to enforce linguistic habits would enhance user immersion in the game world.
- Using Star Wars dataset, it allows us to also add "race" as a feature. In doing so, we hope that specific races will interpret player input contextually to their native speak.
- Optional: Liguistic profile for specific in-game races

Sentiment analysis with output classes corresponding to novel and fantastical sentiments that align with a fantasy text role-playing game world, for use in-game with non-playable character dialogue. The classified sentiment of user input would be used to select dialogue choices from a list of pre-written responses.

Candidate datasets, ranked in order of most to least promising:
