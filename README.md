# rpg-sentiment-analysis

Abstract: WIP

Sentiment analysis with output classes corresponding to novel and fantastical sentiments that align with a fantasy text role-playing game world, for use in-game with non-playable character dialogue. The classified sentiment of user input would be used to select dialogue choices from a list of pre-written responses.

Candidate datasets, ranked in order of most to least promising:
