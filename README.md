# rpg-sentiment-analysis

Abstract: WIP

- Instead of using datasets (i.e. Twitter Sentiment Analysis), we want to use datasets catered specifically to the roleplay environment we want to enforce in our game.
- We believe that limiting our dataset to enforce linguistic habits would enhance the user's immersion in the game world.
- Using Star Wars dataset, it allows us to also add "race" as a feature. In doing so, we hope that specific races will interpret player input in a manner that reflects their native linguistic styles.
- We will categorize each Star Wars character as Human, Robot, or Alien.
- Each race will have 10 sentiment analysis labels: joy, sadness, disgust, fear, anger, surprise, calmness, confusion, anxiety, lust

Sentiment analysis with output classes corresponding to novel and fantastical sentiments that align with a fantasy text role-playing game world, for use in-game with non-playable character dialogue. The classified sentiment of user input would be used to select dialogue choices from a list of pre-written responses.
