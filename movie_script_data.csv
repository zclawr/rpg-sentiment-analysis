Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf sent us on our long journey we find     ourselves looking upon a familiar sight."

53,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Ahaha!
54,The Return of the King,MERRY,"Welcome, my lords to Isengard!"
55,The Return of the King,GIMLI,You young rascals. A merry hunt you've led us on and now we find you     feasting and ' and smoking!
56,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Hmm?
57,The Return of the King,FRODO,"How do you pick up the threads of an old life? How do you go on, when in     your heart you begin to understand there is no going back? There are some     things that time cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep, that have taken     hold."
58,The Return of the King,SAM,Mr Frodo? What is it?
59,The Return of the King,FRODO,It's been four years to the day since Weathertop Sam. It's never really     healed.
60,The Return of the King,SAM,", There and Back Again, a Hobbits tale     by Bilbo Baggins and the Lord of the Rings by Frodo Baggins. You finished     it."
61,The Return of the King,FRODO,Not quite. There's room for a little more.
62,The Return of the King,FRODO,"Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end. That each of us must     come and go in the telling. Bilbo's story was now over. There would be no     more journeys for him. , save one."
63,The Return of the King,BILBO,"Tell me again lad, where are we going?"
64,The Return of the King,FRODO,To the harbour Bilbo. The elves have accorded you a special honour. A place     on the last ship to leave Middle Earth.
65,The Return of the King,BILBO,"Frodo, any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again? The one I gave you?"
66,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"We are sitting on a field of     victory enjoying a few well earned comforts , The salted pork is particularly good."
67,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Salted pork'
68,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Hobbits!
69,The Return of the King,MERRY,We're under orders from Treebeard who's taken over management of Isengard.
70,The Return of the King,TREEBEARD,"Hoooom, young master Gandalf, I'm glad you've come. Wood and water,     stock and stone I can master, but there is a Wizard to manage here locked in     his tower"
71,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,", Show yourself."
72,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Be careful. Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous."
73,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Well then let's just have his head and be done with it.
74,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"No, we need him alive. We need him to talk."
75,The Return of the King,SARUMAN,"You have fought many wars and slain many men Theoden King and made peace afterwards. Can we not take counsel together as we once did, my old friend?Can we not have peace you and I?"
76,The Return of the King,THEODEN,We shall have peace'. We shall have peace when you answer for the     burning of the Westfold and the children that lie dead there! We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead against the gates of the Hornburg' are avenged! When you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows' we shall have peace!
77,The Return of the King,SARUMAN,Gibbets and crows! Dotard! What do you want Gandalf Grahame? Let me guess' the key of Orthanc? Or perhaps the keys of Barad D'r itself? Along with the crowns of the seven Kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!
78,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Your treachery has already cost many lives. Thousands more are now at     risk. But you could save them Saruman. You were deep in the enemy's counsel.
79,The Return of the King,FRODO,I'm sorry uncle. I'm afraid I lost it.
80,The Return of the King,BILBO,"Oh, pity. (He sighs.) I would have like to have held it one last time."
81,The Return of the King,BILBO,Oh! Well here is a sight I have never seen before.
82,The Return of the King,GALADRIL,The power of the three rings is ended. The time has come for the dominion of     men.
83,The Return of the King,ELROND,I Aear c'n ven na mar.
84,The Return of the King,BILBO,I think I'm quite ready for another adventure.
85,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Farewell my brave Hobbits. , My work is now finished.    ,Here at last, on the     shores of the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship. , I will not say do not weep for not all     tears are an evil. , It is time Frodo."
86,The Return of the King,SAM,What does he mean?
87,The Return of the King,FRODO,"We set out to save the Shire Sam and it has been saved, but not for me."
88,The Return of the King,SAM,", You don't mean that. You can't     leave."
89,The Return of the King,FRODO,The last pages are for you Sam.
90,The Return of the King,SARUMAN,"So you have come here for information. I have some for you.    ,Something festers in the heart of Middle Earth. Something that you have failed to see. But the great eye has seen it! Even now he presses his advantage. His attack will come soon.     ,     You are all going to die! But you know this don't you Gandalf? You cannot think that this Ranger will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor. This exile, crept from the shadows will never be crowned King. ,Gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those who are closest to him' those he professes to love! Tell me, what words of comfort did you give the Halfling before you sent him to his doom? The path that you have set him on can only lead to death."
91,The Return of the King,GIMLI,I've heard enough! Shoot him! Stick an arrow in his gob!
92,The Return of the King,GANDALF,No! Come down Saruman and your life will be spared!
93,The Return of the King,SARUMAN,Save your pity and your mercy. I have no use for it!
94,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Saruman'.. your staff is broken!
95,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Grima! You need not follow him! You were not always as you are now. You were once a man of Rohan. Come down.
96,The Return of the King,SARUMAN,A man of Rohan? What is the house of Rohan but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs? The victory at Helms Deep does not belong to you Theoden Horse Master. You are a lesser son of greater sires!
97,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Grima'. Come down! Be free of him!
98,The Return of the King,SARUMAN,Free? He will never be free!
99,The Return of the King,GRIMA,No!
100,The Return of the King,FRODO VOICE OVER,"My dear Sam, you cannot always be torn in two. , You will     have to be one and whole for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be     and to do. Your part in the story will go on."
101,The Return of the King,SAM,"Well, I'm back."
102,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,I didn't think it would end this way.
103,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"End?  No, the journey doesn't end here.  Death is just another path, one that we all must take.    ,  The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back and all turns to silvered glass.  And then you see it."
104,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,What?  Gandalf?  See what?
105,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"White shores and beyond,  a far green country under a swift sunrise."
106,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"Well, , that's not  so bad."
107,The Return of the King,GANDALF,No.  No it isn't.
108,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Rally to me!  To meeee!

112,The Return of the King,EOWYN,It grows so cold.
113,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,It's just the damp of the first spring rain.
114,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,I do not believe this darkness will endure.
115,The Return of the King,SAM,"Look!  The Orcs, they're moving off!"
116,The Return of the King,SARUMAN,Get down cur!
117,The Return of the King,GRIMA,Ah!
118,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Saruman! You were deep in the enemy's counsel. Tell us what you know!
119,The Return of the King,SARUMAN,You withdraw your guard and I will tell you where your doom will be     decided. I will not be held prisoner here!
120,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Send word to all our allies and to every corner of Middle Earth that     still stands free. The enemy moves against us. We need to know where he will     strike.

144,The Return of the King,SOLDIERS ON GATE,"Come on, come on!"
145,The Return of the King,GOTHMOG,Move into the city. Kill all in your path.
146,The Return of the King,ORC,Break it up!  Break it up!
147,The Return of the King,GENERAL,Oy!  I'll have your guts if you don't shut this rabble down!
148,The Return of the King,FRODO,Go Sam.  Now!
149,The Return of the King,GENERAL,Move along scum!

212,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion."
213,The Return of the King,MOUTH OF SAURON,And who is this?  Isildur's heir?  It takes more to make a King than a broken Elvish blade.
214,The Return of the King,GIMLI,I guess that concludes negotiations.
215,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,I do not believe it.  I will not.
216,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,This army.
217,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,In there.

222,The Return of the King,FRODO,I can't go back.
223,The Return of the King,FRODO,What's that smell.
224,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,Orcses' filth. Orcses come in here sometimes.

249,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"NO! , Aaaaaaaaa."
250,The Return of the King,FRODO,I'm so sorry Sam.     I'm so sorry.
251,The Return of the King,GIMLI,What kind of army would linger in such a place?
252,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,"One that is cursed. Long ago the men of the mountains swore an oath to     the last King of Gondor , to come to his aid, to fight. But when     the time came, when Gondor's need was dire, they fled vanishing into the     darkness of the mountain. And so Isildur cursed them, never to rest until     they had fulfilled their pledge. Who shall call them from the grey twilight,     the forgotten people? The heir of him to whom the oath they swore. From the     North shall he come, need shall drive him. He shall pass the door to the     Paths of the Dead."
253,The Return of the King,GIMLI,The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.
254,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,"The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead , and the dead keep it. The     way is shut."
255,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Brego!
256,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,I do not fear death!
257,The Return of the King,GALADRIEL,"This task was appointed to you, Frodo of the Shire. If you do not find a     way, no one will."
258,The Return of the King,EOMER,"The scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded. The lower level's in flames. Everywhere, legions of the enemy advance."
259,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Time is against us. Make ready!
260,The Return of the King,EOWYN,"Take heart Merry. , It will soon be over"
261,The Return of the King,MERRY,"My lady. You are fair and brave and have much to live for    , and many who love you. I     know it is too late to turn aside. I know there is not much point now in     hoping. If I were a knight of Rohan capable of great deeds'but I'm not. I'm a Hobbit. And I know I can't save Middle Earth. I just want to help my friends; Frodo, Sam, Pippin. More than anything I wish I could see them again."
262,The Return of the King,EOMER,Prepare to move out!
263,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Make haste. We ride through the night.
264,The Return of the King,EOWYN,To battle
265,The Return of the King,MERRY,To battle
266,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Back to the gate! Hurry!
267,The Return of the King,GIMLI,"Well this is a thing unheard of. An elf will go underground, where a     dwarf dare not. Oh. Oh, I'd never hear the end of it."
268,The Return of the King,THEODEN,We must ride light and swift. It is a long road ahead and man and beast     must reach the end with the strength to fight.
269,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Little Hobbits do not belong in war Master Meriadoc.
270,The Return of the King,MERRY,All my friends have gone to battle. I would be ashamed to be left     behind.
271,The Return of the King,THEODEN,It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith and none of my riders can bear     you as a burdon.
272,The Return of the King,MERRY,I want to fight!
273,The Return of the King,THEODEN,I will say no more.
274,The Return of the King,EOWYN,Ride with me!
275,The Return of the King,MERRY,My lady!
276,The Return of the King,EOMER,"Form up, move out! Form up, move out!"
277,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Ride! Ride now to Gondor.
278,The Return of the King,GIMLI,What is it? What do you see?
279,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,I see shapes of men and of horses.
280,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Where?
281,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,"Pale banners like shreds of cloud. , Spears rise     like winter thickets through a shroud of mist. The dead are following. They     have been summoned."
282,The Return of the King,GIMLI,"The dead?     Summoned? I knew that! Huh. Huh. , Very good. Very good. , Legolas!"
283,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Do not look down.
284,The Return of the King,KING OF THE DEAD,Who enters my domain?
285,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,One who will have your allegiance.
286,The Return of the King,KING OF THE DEAD,The dead do not suffer the living to pass.
287,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,You will suffer me!
288,The Return of the King,KING OF THE DEAD,The way is shut! It was made by those who are dead. And the dead keep     it. (The Ghostly army closes around them) The way is shut! Now you must die!
289,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,I summon you to     fulfil your oath!
290,The Return of the King,KING OF THE DEAD,None but the King of Gondor may command me!
291,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,"Make way for the King!  Make way, the King is here"
292,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,My lord!
293,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,Hail to you sire!
294,The Return of the King,GRIMBOLD,I bring 500 men from the Westfold my lord.
295,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,"We have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King."
296,The Return of the King,KING OF THE DEAD,That blade was broken!
297,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"It has been remade. ,     Fight for us and regain your honour. What say you? ,What say you?"
298,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Ach! You waste your time Aragorn. They had no honour in life and they     have none now in death.
299,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"I am Isildur's heir. Fight for me and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.    ,What say you?"
300,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"You have my word! Fight and I will release you from this living death!    , What say you?"
301,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Stand you traitors!
302,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Out!
303,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Legolas! Run!
304,The Return of the King,KING OF THE DEAD,We fight!
305,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,"Open the gate, quick!"
306,The Return of the King,IROLAS,Quick! Hurry!
307,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,Faramir! Say not that he has fallen.
308,The Return of the King,IROLAS,They were outnumbered! None survived.
309,The Return of the King,GOTHMOG,Fear. The city is rank with it! Ha ha ha ha. Let us ease their pain.     Release the prisoners!
310,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Where are the riders from Snowbourn?
311,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,None have come my lord.
312,The Return of the King,THEODEN,"Six thousand spears, less than half of what I had hoped for."
313,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.
314,The Return of the King,THEODEN,More will come
315,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.  ,  We have until dawn then we must ride."
316,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,The horses are restless and the men are quiet.
317,The Return of the King,EOMER,They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.
318,The Return of the King,GIMLI,That road there where does that lead?
319,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,"It is the road to the Dimholt, the door under the mountain."
320,The Return of the King,ORC,"Catapults! , ha ha ha."
321,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"My sons are spent! ,     My line has ended!"
322,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,He's alive!
323,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,The     house of Stewards has failed.
324,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,He needs medicine my lord!
325,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,My line has ended!
326,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,My lord!
327,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,Rohan has deserted us!
328,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"Theoden's betrayed me! ABANDON YOUR POSTS! ,FLEE! FLEE FOR YOUR LIVES!"
329,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Prepare for battle. Hurry men! To the wall! Defend the wall! Over here!     Return to your posts.
330,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Send these foul beasts into the Abyss.
331,The Return of the King,GOTHMOG,Stay where you are!
332,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,We need more rubble!
333,The Return of the King,EOMER,None who venture there ever return.  That mountain is evil.
334,The Return of the King,GIMLI,"Aragorn!  ,      Let's find some food."
335,The Return of the King,EOWYN,There.  A true esquire of Rohan.
336,The Return of the King,MERRY,"I'm ready!  , Sorry.  It isn't all that dangerous.  It's not     even sharp."
337,The Return of the King,EOWYN,"To the smithy, go!"
338,The Return of the King,EOMER,You should not encourage him.
339,The Return of the King,EOWYN,You should not doubt him.
340,The Return of the King,EOMER,"I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm."
341,The Return of the King,EOWYN,Why should Merry be left behind?  He has as much cause to go to war as     you.  Why can he not fight for those he loves?
342,The Return of the King,EOMER,"You know as little of war as that Hobbit.   When the fear takes him    , and the blood and the     screams and the horror of battle take hold.  Do you think he would stand and     fight?  He would flee.  And he would be right to do so.     ,  War is the     province of men Eowyn."
343,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,Sir?  King Theoden awaits you my lord.
344,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,Watch out!
345,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,Down to the lower levels quick!
346,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,Double up men!
347,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Hold them back, do not give in to fear. Stand to your posts. Fight!"
348,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Not at the towers! Aim for the trolls, kill the trolls!"
349,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Bring them down!
350,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Fight them back! ,Peregrin Took! Go back to the Citadel."
351,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,They called us out to fight.
352,The Return of the King,GANDALF,This is no place for a Hobbit!
353,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Guard of the Citadel indeed! , Now back up the hill     quickly. Quick!"
354,The Return of the King,GOTHMOG,What are you doing you useless scum?
355,The Return of the King,ORC,The door wont give. It's too strong.
356,The Return of the King,THEODEN,I take my leave.
357,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,My lord Elrond
358,The Return of the King,ELROND,I come on behalf of one whom I love.  Arwen is dying.  She will not long     survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor.  The light of the evenstar is     failing.  As Sauron's power grows her strength wanes.  Arwen's life is now     tied to the fate of the Ring.  The Shadow is upon us Aragorn.  The end has     come.
359,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"It will not be our end, but his."
360,The Return of the King,ELROND,"You ride to war     but not to victory.  Sauron's armies ride on Minas Tirith, this you know.      But in secret he sends another force, which will attack, from the river.    , A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the South.  They will be     in the city in two days.  You're outnumbered Aragorn.  You need more men."
361,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,There are none.
362,The Return of the King,ELROND,There are those that dwell in the mountain.
363,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"Murderers, traitors. You would call upon them to fight?  They believe in     nothing.  They answer to no one"
364,The Return of the King,ELROND,"They will answer to the King of Gondor.  , And'ril, the Flame of the West, forged from the shards of     Narsil."
365,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil.
366,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.
367,The Return of the King,ELROND,The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army     more deadly than any that walks this earth.  Put aside the Ranger.  Become     who you were born to be 'nen i-Estel Edain.
368,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,'-chebin Estel anim.
369,The Return of the King,EOWYN,Why are you doing this?  The war lies to the East.  You cannot leave on     the eve of battle.  You cannot abandon the men.
370,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,What were you thinking Peregrin Took?  What service can a Hobbit offer     such a great lord of men?
371,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,",  It was     well done.  A generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel.     ,     You are to join the tower guard."
372,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,I didn't think they would find any livery that would  fit me.
373,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,It once belonged to a young boy of the city.  A very foolish one who     wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending his studies.
374,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,This was yours?
375,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,"Yes, it was mine.  My father had it made for me."
376,The Return of the King,GOTHMOG,Get back there and smash it down!
377,The Return of the King,ORC,But nothing can breach it!
378,The Return of the King,GOTHMOG,"Grond will breach it! , Bring out the wolf's head."
379,The Return of the King,ORCS,"Grond, Grond, Grond, Grond,     Grond!"
380,The Return of the King,ORCS,"Grond, Grond, Grond, Grond!"
381,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Eowyn'
382,The Return of the King,EOWYN,We need you here.
383,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Why have you come?
384,The Return of the King,EOWYN,Do you not know?
385,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,It is but a shadow and a thought that you love.  I cannot give you what     you seek.
386,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,I have wished you joy since first I saw you.
387,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Just where do you     think you're off to?
388,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Not this time.  This time you must stay Gimli.
389,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Hmmmm
390,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness of     dwarves?
391,The Return of the King,GIMLI,You might as well accept it.  We're going with you laddie.  Aragorn     smiles.
392,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,"What's happening, where is he going?  I don't understand.  (, Lord Aragorn!  Why does     he leave on the eve of battle?"
393,The Return of the King,GAMLING,He leaves because there is no hope.
394,The Return of the King,THEODEN,He leaves because he must.
395,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"Well, I'm taller than you were then.  Though, I'm not likely to grow     anymore, except sideways."
396,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,"It never fitted me either.  Boromir was always the soldier.     ,  They were so alike he and     my father.  Proud, stubborn even, but strong."
397,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,I think you have strength of a different kind.  And one day your father     will see it.
398,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor in peace or war, in living     or dying, from , ' from this hour henceforth     until my lord release me or death take me."
399,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"And I shall not forget it! ,  nor fail to reward  that which is given.     ,      Fealty with love.  ,      Valour with honour.  Disloyalty with vengeance.      ,      I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defences.  Defences     that your brother long held intact."
400,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,What would you have me do?
401,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,I will not yield the River and Pellenor unfought.  Osgiliath must be     retaken.
402,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,My lord Osgiliath is over run.
403,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,Much must be risked in war.    Is there a Captain here who still has the     courage to do his lord's will?
404,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,You wish now that our places had been exchanged.  That I had died and     Boromir had lived.
405,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"Yes, I wish that."
406,The Return of the King,GAMLING,To few have come.  We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.
407,The Return of the King,THEODEN,"No, we cannot.  But we will meet them in battle nonetheless."
408,The Return of the King,THEODEN,"I have left instruction. , The people are to follow your rule in     my stead.     Take up my seat in the Golden Hall. Long may you defend Edoras, if the     battle goes ill."
409,The Return of the King,EOWYN,What other duty would you have me do my lord?
410,The Return of the King,THEODEN,"Duty? ,     no. , I     would have you smile again, not grieve for those whose time has come. You     shall live to see these days renewed , ' and no more despair"
411,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,"Since you are robbed of Boromir I will do what I can in his stead.     ,     If I should return, think better of me father."
412,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,That will depend on the manner of your return.
413,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,Ech!
414,The Return of the King,SAM,What are you up to?  Sneaking off are we?
415,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Sneaking?  Sneaking?  Fat Hobbit is always so polite.  Smeagol shows     them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say 'sneak!'  Sneak?      Very nice friend, oh yes my precious very nice , very nice!"
416,The Return of the King,SAM,Alright!  Alright!  You just startled me is all.  What were you doing?
417,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,Sneaking.
418,The Return of the King,SAM,"Fine, have it your own way.  ,  I'm sorry to wake you Mr Frodo but we have to be     moving on."
419,The Return of the King,FRODO,It's dark still.
420,The Return of the King,SAM,"It's always dark here.  ,  It's gone!     , The elven bread!"
421,The Return of the King,FRODO,What?  That's all we have left!
422,The Return of the King,MADRIL,We can't hold them.  The city is lost.
423,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,Tell the men to break cover.  We ride for Minas Tirith.
424,The Return of the King,DAMROD,Nazg'l!
425,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,Take cover!  Nazgul!  Fall     back.  Fall back to Minas Tirith!
426,The Return of the King,SAM,He took it.  He must have.
427,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Smeagol?  No, no, not poor Smeagol.  Smeagol hates nasty elf bread."
428,The Return of the King,SAM,You're a lying rat!  What did you do with it?
429,The Return of the King,FRODO,"He doesn't     eat it. , He can't have taken     it."
430,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Look, what's this?  ,  Crumbs on his jacketses.  He took it! ,He took it! ,  I've seen him, he's always stuffing his face when master's     not looking."
431,The Return of the King,SAM,"That's a filthy lie!  ,      You stinking, two faced sneak!"
432,The Return of the King,FRODO,Sam!
433,The Return of the King,SAM,Call me'
434,The Return of the King,FRODO,Stop it!
435,The Return of the King,SAM,I'll kill him!
436,The Return of the King,FRODO,"Sam, no!"
437,The Return of the King,SAM,"Oh my!   I'm sorry.  I didn't mean it to go so far.  I was just     so, so angry!  Here just' let's just rest a bit."
438,The Return of the King,FRODO,I'm all right.
439,The Return of the King,SAM,"No.  No you're not all right, you're exhausted.  It's that Gollum.  It's     this place.  It's that thing around your neck.  , I could help a bit.  I could carry it for     a while ,,     carry it for a while ,      I could carry it' I could carry it' Share the load' share the load' share     the load"
440,The Return of the King,FRODO,Get away!
441,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,"Fall back!  ,  Retreat!  Retreat!  Run for your lives!"
442,The Return of the King,GOTHMOG,The age of men is over.  The time of the Orc has come.
443,The Return of the King,SOLDIERS,"Keep going.  It's the Nazgul.  Take cover my lord.     ,     It's coming."
444,The Return of the King,SOLDIERS IN MINAS TIRITH,Its Mithrandir!  The White Rider!
445,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,Pull!
446,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,"Mithrandir!  ,     They broke through our defences.  They've taken the bridge and the West     bank.  Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river."
447,The Return of the King,IROLAS,It is as the Lord Denethor predicted!  Long has he foreseen this doom!
448,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Foreseen and done nothing!
449,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Faramir?  This is not the first Halfling to have crossed your path.
450,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,No.
451,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,You've seen Frodo and Sam?
452,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Where?  When?
453,The Return of the King,SAM,"I don't want to keep it.  , I just want to help."
454,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,See?  See?  He wants it for himself.
455,The Return of the King,SAM,"Shut up you!  ,  Go away!  Get     out of here!"
456,The Return of the King,FRODO,"No Sam!  It's you!  ,      I'm sorry Sam."
457,The Return of the King,SAM,But he's a liar!  He's poisoned     you against me.
458,The Return of the King,FRODO,You can't help me any more.
459,The Return of the King,SAM,You don't mean that.
460,The Return of the King,FRODO,Go home.
461,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Faramir!  Faramir!     , Your     father's will has turned to madness.  Do not throw away your life so     rashly."
462,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,"Where does my allegiance lie if not here?  This is the city of the men     of N'menor.  I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty, her memory,     her wisdom."
463,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Your father loves you Faramir.  ,  He will remember it before the end."
464,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,Can you sing Master Hobbit?
465,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"well, yes.  At least well     enough for my own people.  But we have no songs for great halls and evil     times."
466,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift."
467,The Two Towers,GANDALF,The battle for Helm's Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
468,The Two Towers,GANDALF,(looking back out to Mordor) All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...
469,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,"In Ithilien.  Not two days ago.  Gandalf, they're taking the road to the     Morgul vale."
470,The Return of the King,GANDALF,And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.
471,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,What does that mean? What's wrong?  He looks at Gandalf.
472,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Faramir tell me everything.  Tell me all you know.
473,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,This is how you would serve your city?  You would risk its utter     ruin?
474,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,I did what I judged to be right.
475,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"What you judged to be right!  You sent the Ring of power into Mordor in     the hands of a witless Halfling!  It should have been brought back to the     citadel to be kept safe. Hidden.  Dark and deep in the vaults' not to be     used.  ,      unless, at the uttermost end of need."
476,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,I would not use the Ring.  Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin and     I alone could save her.
477,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious as a King of old.       Boromir would have remembered his father's need.   He would have brought me     a kingly gift
478,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,Boromir would not have brought the Ring.   He would have stretched     out his hand to this thing and taking it he would have fallen.
479,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"And why should your songs be unfit for my halls?  Come, sing me a song."
480,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"Home is behind, The world ahead, ,  And     there are many paths to tread, Through shadow, to the edge of night    ,      Until the stars are all alight. ,  Mist and shadow     cloud and shade, All shall fade, All shall , 'fade."
481,The Return of the King,ORCS,"March, march!   March, march march!"
482,The Two Towers,GANDALF VOICEOVER,...somewhere in the wilderness.
483,The Two Towers,SAM,I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
484,The Two Towers,FRODO,What?
485,The Two Towers,SAM,"I wonder if people will ever say,      ""Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring.""      And they'll say,      ""Yes! That's one of my favourite stories.""      ""Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad? ""      ""Yes, my boy. ,The most famousest of Hobbits.      And that's saying a lot."","
486,The Two Towers,FRODO,"Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:      ""Samwise the Brave.""      I want to hear more about Sam."
487,The Two Towers,FRODO,Frodo wouldn't have got far      without Sam.
488,The Two Towers,SAM,"Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun. I was being serious."
489,The Two Towers,FRODO,"So was l. ,"
490,The Two Towers,SAM,"""Samwise the Brave."""
491,The Two Towers,FRODO,Smeagol?
492,The Two Towers,SAM,"We're not going to wait for you. Come on.,"
493,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,"Master. Master looks after us. ,Master wouldn't hurt us."
494,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Master broke his promise.
495,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,"Don't ask Smeagol. Poor, poor Smeagol."
496,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"Master betrayed us. Wicked. Tricksy. False. ,We ought to wring his filthy little neck.,Kill him! Kill him! Kill them both! ,And then we take the precious......and we be the master!"
497,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,You know nothing of this matter!
498,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,He would have kept it for his own.  And when he returned you would not     have known your son.
499,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,Boromir was loyal to me!   Not some wizard's pupil.
500,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,Father?
501,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"My son!  ,  Leave me!"
502,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,Careful master!  Careful.   Very far to fall.  Very dangerous are the     stairs.
503,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,Come master.
504,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,Come to Smeagol.
505,The Return of the King,SAM,"Mr Frodo!  , Get back     you!  Don't touch him."
506,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Why does he hates poor Smeagol?  What has Smeagol ever done to him?      Master?  ,Master carries a heavy     burden Smeagol knows, heavy heavy burden.  Fat one cannot know.  ,  He wants it.  He needs     it.  Smeagol sees it in his eye.  , Very soon he will ask you for it.  You     will see.   The fat one will take it from you!"
507,The Return of the King,WITCH KING,Send forth all legions.  Do not stop the attack until the city is     taken.
508,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,"But the fat Hobbit, he knows.      Eyes always watching."
509,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Then we stabs them out. Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
510,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,Yes. Yes. Yes.
511,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Kill them both.
512,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,"Yes. , No! No! ,It's too risky. It's too risky."
513,The Two Towers,SAM,"Where is he? Where has he gone? Hey, Gollum! Where are you?"
514,The Two Towers,FRODO,Smeagol?
515,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"We could let , do it."
516,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,Yes. She could do it.
517,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"Yes, precious, she could. And then we takes it once they're dead."
518,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,"Once they're dead. ,Ssssssssssssssh!"
519,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,"Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet. , Smeagol will show you the way."
520,The Two Towers,EOMER,Stay out of the forest! Keep away from the trees!
521,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,Final count.....42.
522,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"Forty-two? That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling. I myself am sitting pretty on 43.,"
523,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,Forty-three.
524,The Two Towers,GIMLI,He was already dead.
525,The Return of the King,WITCH KING,Slay them all!
526,The Return of the King,GOTHMOG,What of the wizard?
527,The Return of the King,WITCH KING,I will break him.
528,The Return of the King,SOLDIER 1,Where are Theoden's riders?
529,The Return of the King,SOLDIER 2,Will Rohan's army come?  Mithrandir?
530,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Courage is the best defence that you have now.
531,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Follow me.
532,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,He was twitching.
533,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"He was twitching......because he's got my axe ,embedded in his nervous system!"
534,The Two Towers,MERRY,"He doesn't look too happy, does he?"
535,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"Not too happy at all, Merry."
536,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there."
537,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment. I hear the staff are very good."
538,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,What are you doing?
539,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Nothing. The world's back to normal, that's all."
540,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"No, it isn't. I'm starving."
541,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Good luck trying to find something decent around here. ,Probably only dead rats and      mouldy bread.,"
542,The Two Towers,MERRY,Saruman's storeroom!
543,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,I don't believe it.
544,The Two Towers,MERRY,It can't be.
545,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,lt is!
546,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Longbottom Leaf. ,The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing."
547,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"It's perfect. One barrel each.,Wait.      Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?"
548,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Share it? ,No. No. ,Dead plant and all that. Don't think he'd understand. ,Could be a distant relative."
549,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,I get it. Don't be hasty.
550,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Exactly.      , Bar-hrum."
551,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,This is the old sewer. Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.      You'll find cover in the woods there.
552,The Two Towers,SAM,"Captain Faramir......you have shown your quality, sir."
553,The Two Towers,SAM,The very highest.
554,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,The Shire must truly be a great realm      Master Gamgee......where gardeners are held in high honor.
555,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,What road will you take once you reach the woods?
556,The Two Towers,FRODO,"Gollum says there's a path......near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.,"
557,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"Cirith Ungol?,"
558,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,ls that its name?
559,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"No. ,No! , Yes."
560,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,Frodo......they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas      Morgul. You cannot go that way.
561,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"lt is the only way. Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try."
562,The Two Towers,FRODO,I must.
563,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"Go, Frodo. Go with the goodwill of all Men.,"
564,The Two Towers,FRODO,Thank you.
565,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
566,The Two Towers,SAM,"Come on, keep up."
567,The Two Towers,SAM,"Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you. You know that, don't you?      He was trying to save you, see?"
568,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Save me?
569,The Two Towers,SAM,So there's no hard feelings. Forgive and forget.
570,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"No, no, no hard feelings. Gollum, Gollum. ,Yes, master. Nice Hobbits."
571,The Two Towers,SAM,"Very decent of you. Very decent, indeed      Gollum."
572,The Two Towers,MADRIL,Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern shore. Their numbers are too great.      By nightfall we will be overrun.
573,The Two Towers,SAM,Mr. Frodo?
574,The Two Towers,FRODO,"It's calling to him, Sam. His Eye is almost on me."
575,The Two Towers,SAM,"Hold on, Mr. Frodo. You'll be all right."
576,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"Take them to my father. ,Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.      ,A weapon that will change our fortunes      in this war. ,"
577,The Two Towers,SAM,"Do you want to know      what happened to Boromir? ,You want to know why your brother died?  He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him! ,He tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad!"
578,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Watch out!
579,The Two Towers,SAM,Mr. Frodo?
580,The Two Towers,FRODO,They're here.
581,The Two Towers,FRODO,They've come.
582,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,Nazgul!
583,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"Stay here. Keep out of sight. ,Take cover!"
584,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"The fortress is taken. It is over.,"
585,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.      They still defend it. They have died defending it.
586,The Two Towers,WOMAN,They are breaking in!
587,The Two Towers,WOMAN,They're past the door!
588,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Is there no other way for the women      and children to get out of the caves?
589,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Is there no other way?
590,The Two Towers,GAMLING,There is one passage. It leads into the mountains. But they will not get far.      The Uruk-hai are too many.
591,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Tell the women and children      to make for the mountain pass. And barricade the entrance!
592,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get your men out of there!,"
593,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Nan Barad! Nan Barad! , Haldir, nan Barad! ("
594,The Two Towers,GIMLI,What are you doing? What are you stopping for?
595,The Two Towers,HALDIR,Nan Barad! (To the Keep!)
596,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Haldir!
597,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"So much death. ,  What can Men do against such reckless hate?"
598,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Ride out with me. ,Ride out and meet them.,"
599,The Two Towers,THEODEN,For death and glory.
600,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,For Rohan. For your people.
601,The Two Towers,GIMLI,The sun is rising.
602,The Two Towers,GANDALF VOICEOVER,Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn......Iook to the east.
603,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Yes.........Yes.........The horn of Helm Hammerhand......shall sound in the Deep......one last time.
604,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"Yes!,"
605,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"Let this be the hour      when we draw swords together. ,"
606,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"Fell deeds, awake. Now for wrath......now for ruin and a red dawn.,"
607,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"Forth Eorlingas!,"
608,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Gandalf.
609,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"Theoden King stands alone.,"
610,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Brace the gate!
611,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Hold them!
612,The Two Towers,THEODEN,To the gate. Draw your swords!
613,The Two Towers,GAMLING,"Make way! ( ,We cannot hold much longer!"
614,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Hold them!
615,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,How long do you need?
616,The Two Towers,THEODEN,As long as you can give me.
617,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Gimli!
618,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Timbers! Brace the gate!
619,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Come on. We can take them.
620,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,It's a long way.
621,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Toss me.
622,The Two Towers,EOMER,"Not alone. , Rohirrim!"
623,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"Eomer.,"
624,The Two Towers,EOMER,To the king!
625,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Yes!
626,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,A hit. A fine hit.
627,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,Break the dam!  Release the river!
628,The Two Towers,MERRY,Pippin! Hold on!
629,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"Hold on, little Hobbits."
630,The Two Towers,SAM,What are you doing?
631,The Two Towers,SAM,Where are you going?
632,The Two Towers,SAM,It's me. It's your Sam. Don't you know your Sam?
633,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,What?
634,The Two Towers,GIMLI,I cannot jump the distance! You'll have to toss me!
635,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Don't tell the Elf.
636,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Not a word.
637,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Shore up the door!
638,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Make way!
639,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Follow me to the barricade.
640,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Watch our backs!
641,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Throw another one over here!
642,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Higher!
643,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Hold fast the gate!
644,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!
645,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,Aragorn!
646,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Pull everybody back. Pull them back.
647,The Two Towers,GAMLING,Fall back! Fall back!
648,The Two Towers,FRODO,"I can't do this, Sam."
649,The Two Towers,SAM,"I know. It's all wrong.      ,By rights, we shouldn't even be here.      But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered.      ,Full of darkness and danger they were.      And sometimes you didn't want to know the end.....because how could the end be happy?       How could the world go back      to the way it was...... when so much bad had happened?"
650,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Victory! We have victory!
651,The Two Towers,SAM VOICEOVER,"But in the end, it's only a passing thing...... this shadow. Even darkness must pass.      A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.      Those were the stories      that stayed with you......that meant something. Even if you were too small      to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now."
652,The Two Towers,SAM,"Folk in those stories......had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.      They kept going......because they were holding on to something."
653,The Two Towers,FRODO,"What are we holding on to, Sam?"
654,The Two Towers,SAM,"That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it's worth fighting for."
655,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins. ,"
656,The Two Towers,MADRIL,"You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father. If you let them go      your life will be forfeit."
657,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"Then it is forfeit. Release them.,"
658,The Two Towers,THEODEN,They have broken through! The castle is breached. Retreat!
659,The Two Towers,GAMLING,Fall back!
660,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Retreat!
661,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!
662,The Two Towers,GAMLING,Into the Keep!
663,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,I will leave you at the western borders of the forest. You can make your way north      to your homeland from there.
664,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Wait! Stop! Stop! Turn around. Turn around. Take us south.
665,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,South? But that will lead you past lsengard.
666,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"Yes. Exactly.,If we go south, we can slip      past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.      It's the last thing he'll expect."
667,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"That doesn't make sense to me.      But then......you are very small. ,Perhaps you're right. South it is, then.      Hold on, little Shirelings. ,I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going downhill.,"
668,The Two Towers,MERRY,Are you mad? We'll be caught.
669,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"No, we won't. Not this time."
670,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Look! Osgiliath burns!
671,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Mordor has come.
672,The Two Towers,FRODO,"The Ring will not save Gondor.      , It has only the power to destroy.      Please......Iet me go."
673,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,Hurry.
674,The Two Towers,FRODO,Faramir! You must let me go!
675,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"And those little family of field mice......that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully."
676,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,They're always trying to get somewhere where they....
677,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,Many of these trees were my friends. Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
678,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"I'm sorry, Treebeard."
679,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,They had voices of their own.
680,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,Saruman. A wizard should know better!
681,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,There is no curse in Elvish......Entish or the tongues of Men......for this treachery.
682,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"You could have picked a better spot.,"
683,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night."
684,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,"Your friends are with you, Aragorn."
685,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Let's hope they last the night.
686,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"A      Eruch'n, '-dano i faelas a hyn an uben tanatha le faelas! ,"
687,The Two Towers,GIMLI,What's happening out there?
688,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,Shall I describe it to you? Or would you like me to find you a box?
689,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Look! The trees! They're moving!
690,The Two Towers,MERRY,Where are they going?
691,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,They have business with the Orcs. My business is with lsengard tonight......with rock and stone.
692,The Two Towers,MERRY,Yes!
693,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"Come, my friends. The Ents are going to war. It is likely......that we go to our doom.      Last march......of the Ents."
694,The Two Towers,THEODEN,So it begins.
695,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Tangado a chadad!
696,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,Faeg i-varv d'n na lanc a      nu ranc.
697,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Leithio i philinn!
698,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"Did they hit anything?,"
699,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Give them a volley.
700,The Two Towers,GAMLING,Fire!
701,The Two Towers,OLD MAN,Fire!
702,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Ribed bant!
703,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"Send them to me! Come on!,"
704,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Pendraith! ,"
705,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Good!
706,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Swords! Swords!
707,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Legolas! Two already!
708,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,I'm on 17!
709,The Two Towers,GIMLI,I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
710,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,Nineteen!
711,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Merry.
712,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"We have just agreed.,"
713,The Two Towers,MERRY,Yes?
714,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"I have told your names to the Entmoot......and we have agreed......you are not      Orcs.,"
715,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"Well, that's good news."
716,The Two Towers,MERRY,And what about Saruman? Have you come to a decision about him?
717,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc."
718,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Hasty? Our friends are out there. ,They need our help. They cannot fight this war on their own."
719,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"War? Yes. It affects us all. Tree, root and twig.      But you must understand, young Hobbit......it takes a long time......to say anything in Old      Entish... ,...and we never say anything......unless it is worth taking......a long time to say.,"
720,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty! Twenty-one!
721,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Causeway!
722,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Is this it? Is this is all you can conjure      Saruman?
723,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Togo hon dad, Legolas! ,"
724,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Dago hon! Dago hon!
725,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Brace the gate!
726,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Hold them! Stand firm!
727,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Aragorn!
728,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Gimli!
729,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Hado i philinn!
730,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Herio!
731,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"The Ents cannot hold back this storm. We must weather such things as we have always done.,"
732,The Two Towers,MERRY,How can that be your decision?!
733,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"This is not our war.,"
734,The Two Towers,MERRY,"But you're part of this world!      Aren't you?!,"
735,The Two Towers,MERRY,You must help. Please. You must do something.
736,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"You are young and brave, Master Merry. But your part in this tale is over.      Go back to your home.,"
737,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"Maybe Treebeard's right. We don't belong here, Merry. It's too big for us.      What can we do in the end? We've got the Shire. Maybe we should go home.,"
738,The Two Towers,MERRY,"The fires of lsengard will spread......and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.      And.... ,And all that was once green and good      in this world will be gone. There won't be a Shire, Pippin."
739,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Boromir! Boromir!
740,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,"This city was once the jewel of our kingdom. A place of light and beauty     and music. And so it shall be once more! ,Let the armies of Mordor know this:     Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.    ,This city of Osgiliath has been     reclaimed ,for     Gondor!"
741,The Two Towers,CROWD,For Gondor!
742,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,For Gondor!
743,The Two Towers,CROWD,For Gondor!
744,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,For Gondor!
745,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,Good speech. Nice and short.
746,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,Leaves more time for drinking!     Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!
747,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,"Remember today, little brother. Today, life is good."
748,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,What?
749,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,He's here.
750,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,"One moment of peace, can he not give us that?"
751,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,Where is he? Where is Gondor's finest? Where's my first-born?
752,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,Father!
753,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
754,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,They exaggerate. The victory belongs to Faramir also.
755,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,"But for Faramir, this city would still be standing."
756,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,Were you not entrusted to protect it?
757,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"I would have done, but our numbers were too few."
758,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,"Oh, too few. You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim. Always you     cast a poor reflection on me."
759,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,That is not my intent.
760,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,"You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will."
761,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,"He loves you, Father."
762,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,"Do not trouble me with Faramir......I know his uses, and they are few.     We have more urgent things to speak of. Elrond of Rivendell has called a     meeting. He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose. It is rumored     that the weapon of the enemy has been found."
763,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,The One Ring. lsildur's     Bane.
764,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,"lt has fallen into the hands of     the Elves. Everyone will try to claim it: Men, Dwarves, wizards. We cannot     let that happen. This thing must come to Gondor."
765,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,Gondor.
766,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,"It's dangerous,     I know. Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men. But     you, you are strong.    And our need is great. It is our blood which is being spilled, our people     who are dying. Sauron is biding his time. He's massing fresh armies. He will     return. And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him. You must go.    ,Bring me back this     mighty gift    ."
767,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,"No. My place is here with     my people. ,Not in Rivendell."
768,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,Would you deny your own father?
769,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,lf there is need to go to Rivendell......send me in his stead.
770,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,"You? Oh, I see. A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his     quality. I think not. ,I trust this mission only to your brother. The one who will not     fail me."
771,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,"Remember today, little brother."
772,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,"Captain Faramir! ,We     found the third one."
773,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,You must come with me. Now.
774,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,Down there.
775,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.    ,They wait for my command. Shall I     shoot?"
776,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,The rock and pool    Is nice and cool    So juicy sweet    Our only wish    To catch a fish    So juicy sweet
777,The Two Towers,FRODO,Wait. This creature is bound to me. And I to him. He is our guide.     Please......Iet me go down to him.
778,The Two Towers,FRODO,"Smeagol. , Master is here.     Come, Smeagol. Trust master. Come."
779,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,We must go now?
780,The Two Towers,FRODO,"Smeagol, you must trust master. Follow me. Come on. Come. Come, Smeagol.     Nice Smeagol. That's it. Come on."
781,The Two Towers,FRODO,"Don't hurt him! ,Smeagol, don't struggle. Smeagol, listen     to me."
782,The Two Towers,ARWEN,May the grace of the Valarprotect you.

785,The Two Towers,ARWEN,I have made my choice.
786,The Two Towers,ELROND,He is not coming back.Why do you linger herewhen there is no hope?
787,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Master!
788,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"That's enough. ,Where     are you leading them? ,Answer me."
789,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"Smeagol. Why does it cry, Smeagol?"
790,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,Cruel Men hurts us. Master     tricksed us.
791,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Of course he did. I told you he was tricksy. I told you he was false.
792,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,Master is our friend. Our friend.
793,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Master betrayed us.
794,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,No. Not its business. Leave us alone!
795,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Filthy little     Hobbitses! They stole it from us!
796,The Two Towers,ARWEN,There is still hope.
797,The Two Towers,ELROND,If Aragorn survives this waryou will still be parted.If Sauron is defeatedand Aragorn made king......and all that you hope forcomes true......you will still have to tastethe bitterness of mortality.
798,The Two Towers,ELROND VOICEOVER,Whether by the swordor the slow decay of time......Aragorn will die.And there will be no comfortfor you......no comfort to ease the painof his passing.He will come to death......an image of the splendorof the kings of Men......in glory undimmed beforethe breaking of the world.
799,The Two Towers,ELROND VOICEOVER,"But you, my daughter......you will linger on in darknessand in doubt......as nightfall in winterthat comes without a star.Here you will dwell......bound to your griefunder the fading trees...... until all the world is changed......and the long years of your lifeare utterly spent."
800,The Two Towers,ELROND,"Arwen.,There is nothing for you here......only death."

804,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,What news?
805,The Two Towers,MADRIL,"Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan. , Theoden's people have fled     to Helm's Deep. But we must look to our own borders. Faramir, Orcs are on     the move. Sauron is marshaling an army. Easterlings and Southrons are at the     Black Gate."
806,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,How many?
807,The Two Towers,MADRIL,Some thousands. More come every day.
808,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,Who's covering the river to the north?
809,The Two Towers,MADRIL,"We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath. If their city is attacked, we won't hold     it."
810,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,No. No.
811,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,What did they steal?
812,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,My precious!
813,The Two Towers,SAM,"We have to get out of here.     You go. Go, now. You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put     it on. Disappear."
814,The Two Towers,FRODO,"I can't. You were right, Sam. You tried to tell me but....,I'm sorry. The Ring's taking me, Sam. If I put it     on......he'll find me. He'll see."
815,The Two Towers,SAM,Mr.     Frodo....
816,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"So this is the answer to all the riddles. ,Here in the     Wild I have you......two Halflings......and a host of men at my call.,The Ring of Power within my     grasp.,A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor......to     show his quality."
817,The Two Towers,FRODO,No!
818,The Two Towers,SAM,"Stop it! Leave him alone. ,Don't you understand? He's got to destroy     it! That's where we're going, into Mordor. To the Mountain of Fire!"
819,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Osgiliath is under attack. They call for reinforcements.
820,The Two Towers,SAM,Please. It's such a burden.     Will you not help him?
821,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Captain?
822,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"Prepare to leave.    ,The Ring will go to Gondor."
823,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Mae carnen, Brego,     mellon n'n."
824,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,Saruman attacks from lsengard. Sauron from Mordor. The fight will come to     Men on both fronts. Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us soon. And he will     strike hard. He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
825,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
826,The Two Towers,SAM,Spies? Now wait just a minute.
827,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?"
828,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,Speak.
829,The Two Towers,FRODO,"We are Hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is     Samwise Gamgee."
830,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,Your bodyguard?
831,The Two Towers,SAM,His gardener.
832,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,And where is your skulking friend? That gangrel creature. He had an ill-favored     look.
833,The Two Towers,FRODO,"There was no other.    ,We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in Moria......two     were my kin......a Dwarf there was also. And an Elf and two Men. Aragorn,     son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor."
834,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,You're a friend of Boromir?
835,The Two Towers,FRODO,Yes.  For my part.
836,The Two Towers,WOMAN,He's alive!
837,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"Where is he? Where is he?,Get out of the     way! I'm going to kill him!,You are the luckiest, the canniest    ,.....and the most reckless man     I ever knew. Bless you, laddie."
838,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Gimli, where is the king?"
839,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,"Le abdollen. ,You look terrible."
840,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Hannon le.
841,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"A great host, you say?"
842,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,All lsengard is emptied.
843,The Two Towers,THEODEN,How many?
844,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Ten thousand strong at least.
845,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Ten thousand?
846,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,It is an army bred for a single purpose: To destroy the world of Men.     They will be here by nightfall.
847,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Let them come!
848,The Two Towers,THEODEN,I want every man and strong     lad able to bear arms......to be ready for battle by nightfall.
849,The Two Towers,THEODEN,We will cover the causeway and the gate from above. No army has ever     breached the Deeping Wall......or set foot inside the Hornburg!
850,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,It will grieve you then to     learn that he is dead.
851,The Two Towers,FRODO,Dead? How? When?
852,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me."
853,The Two Towers,FRODO,"If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us."
854,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past. It was     cloven in two. But more than this, I know it in my heart.    ,He was my brother."
855,The Two Towers,GIMLI,This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. These are Uruk-hai. Their armour is     thick and their shields broad.
856,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. I know how to defend my own keep."
857,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.    ,Saruman's     hordes will pillage and burn.    We've seen it before. Crops can be resown......homes rebuilt. Within these     walls......we will outlast them."
858,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages. They come to     destroy its people......down to the last child.
859,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a     thread. If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an     end......as to be worthy of remembrance."
860,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Send out riders, my lord. You must call for aid."
861,The Two Towers,THEODEN,And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We are not so lucky in our friends as     you. The old alliances are dead.
862,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Gondor will answer.
863,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"(    Gondor?! Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?! Where was Gondor when our     enemies closed in around us?! Where was Gon--? ,No, my Lord     Aragorn......we are alone. ,Get the women and children     into the caves."
864,The Two Towers,GAMLING,We need more time to lay provisions--
865,The Two Towers,ARWEN VOICEOVER,The light of the Evenstardoes not wax and wane.It is mine to give to whom I will.Like my heart.Go to sleep.
866,The Two Towers,ARAGORN ,"I am asleep.,This is a dream."
867,The Two Towers,ARWEN,"Then it is a good dream. ,Sleep."

872,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,Master's my friend.
873,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,You don't have any friends.Nobody likes you.
874,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,Not listening. I'm not listening.
875,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,You're a liar and a thief.
876,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,No.
877,The Two Towers,THEODEN,There is no time. War is upon us. Secure the gate.
878,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"We Ents have not troubled......about the wars of Men and     wizards......for a very long time. But now, something is about to     happen......that has not happened......for an age.,Entmoot."
879,The Two Towers,MERRY,What's that?
880,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,'Tis a gathering.
881,The Two Towers,MERRY,A     gathering of what?
882,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"Beech. Oak. Chestnut. Ash. Good. Good. Good. Many have come.,Now we must decide if the Ents......will     go to war."

949,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"What do you fear, my lady?"
950,The Two Towers,EOWYN,A cage.To stay behind bars until useand old age accept them.And all chance of valor has gonebeyond recall or desire.
951,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,You're a daughter of kings......a shieldmaiden of Rohan.I do not think that would be your fate.

983,The Two Towers,SAM,Wait! We're innocent travelers!
984,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,There are no travelers in this land.Only servants of the Dark Tower.
985,The Two Towers,FRODO,We are bound to an errand of secrecy.Those that claim to oppose the enemywould do well not to hinder us.
986,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"The enemy? ,His sense of duty was no lessthan yours, I deem.,You wonder what his name is......where he came from.,And if he was really evil at heart.,What lies or threats led himon this long march from home.,If he would not rather have stayed there......in peace.,War will make corpses of us all.,Bind their hands."
987,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"It's true, you don't seemany Dwarf women.And in fact, they are so alikein voice and appearance......that they're often mistakenfor Dwarf men."
988,The Two Towers,FRODO,Because I have to believehe can come back.
989,The Two Towers,SAM,"You can't save him, Mr. Frodo."
990,The Two Towers,FRODO,"What do you know about it?Nothing! ,I'm sorry, Sam. I don't knowwhy I said that."
991,The Two Towers,SAM,"I do. ,It's the Ring.You can't take your eyes off it.I've seen you.You're not eating. You barely sleep. ,It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo. You have to fight it."
992,The Two Towers,FRODO,"I know what I have to do, Sam.The Ring was entrusted to me.It's my task.Mine! My own!"
993,The Two Towers,SAM,Can't you hear yourself?Don't you know who you sound like?

1017,The Return of the King,SAM,"It's gone Mr Frodo. The light's passed on, away towards the North.     Something's drawn its gaze."
1018,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Hold your ground! Hold your ground!
1019,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers. (They listen to him.) I see it in     your eyes, the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come     when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all     bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day! An hour of wolves and shattered     shields when the age of men comes crashing down, but it is not this day!     This day we fight!"
1020,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand! Men of the     West!"
1021,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an elf.
1022,The Two Towers,GANDALF,The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.Sauron will suffer no rival.From the summit of Barad-durhis Eye watches ceaselessly.But he is not so mighty yetthat he is above fear.Doubt ever gnaws at him.The rumor has reached him.The heir of Numenor still lives.
1023,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,It's the beards.
1024,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"This, in turn, has given riseto the belief......that there are no Dwarf women......and that Dwarves just spring outof holes in the ground..."
1025,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"...which is, of course, ridiculous."
1026,The Two Towers,GIMLI,It's all right. Nobody panic.That was deliberate.It was deliberate.
1027,The Two Towers,THEODEN,I haven't seen my niece smilefor a long time.She was a girl when they broughther father back dead.Cut down by Orcs.She watched her mothersuccumb to grief.
1028,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Then she was left aloneto tend her king in growing fear.Doomed to wait upon an old manwho should have loved her as a father.
1029,The Two Towers,EOWYN,Gimli.?
1030,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"No, I couldn'tI really couldn't."
1031,The Two Towers,GAMLING,Make way for the king.Make way for Theoden.Make way for the king.
1032,The Two Towers,EOWYN,So few. So few of you have returned.
1033,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Our people are safe.We have paid for it with many lives.
1034,The Two Towers,GIMLI,My lady.
1035,The Two Towers,EOWYN,Lord Aragorn......where is he?
1036,The Two Towers,GIMLI,He fell.
1037,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Draw all our forces behind the wall.Bar the gate.And set a watch on the surround.
1038,The Two Towers,GAMLING,"What of those who cannot fight, my lord?The women and children?"
1039,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"Get them into the caves. , Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can     reach us here."
1040,The Two Towers,GRIMA,Helm's Deep has one weakness.Its outer wall is solid rock......but for a small culvertat its base...... which is little more than a drain.
1041,The Two Towers,GRIMA,How? How can fire undo stone?
1042,The Two Towers,EOWYN,Sssh
1043,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.    ,All     the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet     him head on. Draw him away from your women and children.    , You must     fight."
1044,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak. Eomer is loyal to you.     His men will return and fight for their king.
1045,The Two Towers,THEODEN,They will be 300     leagues from here by now. Eomer cannot help us. I know what it is you want     of me......but I will not bring further death to my people. I will not risk     open war.
1046,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not."
1047,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"When last I looked......Theoden, not Aragorn, was King of Rohan."
1048,The Two Towers,HAMA,By order of the king......the city must empty. We make for the refuge of     Helm's Deep.
1049,The Two Towers,HAMA,Do not burden yourself with treasures. Take only what provisions you     need.
1050,The Two Towers,GANDALF,Helm's Deep.
1051,The Two Towers,GIMLI,They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. Who will     defend them if not their king?
1052,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helm's Deep has     saved them in the past.
1053,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"There is no way out of that ravine. Theoden is walking into a trap. He     thinks he's leading them to safety. What they will get is a massacre.     Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of     Rohan. , He will need     you before the end,    Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. ,The defenses , to hold."
1054,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,"What about side by side with a friend? ,"
1055,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Aye! I could do that.
1056,The Return of the King,SAM,"Do you remember the Shire Mr Frodo? It will be Spring soon and the orchards     will be in blossom. And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thickets. (He     is crying.) And they will be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields,     (Frodo opens his eyes and looks at him.) and eating the first of the     strawberries and cream. Do you remember the taste of strawberries?"
1057,The Return of the King,FRODO,"No Sam. I can't recall the taste of food, nor the sound of water or the     touch of grass. I'm naked in the dark. There's' there's nothing, no veil     between me and the wheel of fire. ,I can see him with my waking eyes!"
1058,The Return of the King,SAM,"Then let us be rid of it once and for all! Come on Mr Frodo, I can't carry     it for you, but I can carry you! Come on!"
1059,The Return of the King,EYE OF SAURON,"Aragorn! ,     Elessar!"
1060,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,For Frodo.
1061,The Return of the King,SAM,"Look Mr Frodo, a doorway! We're almost there!"
1062,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Clever Hobbits to climb so high! ,Mustn't go that way. Mustn't hurt the     precious!"
1063,The Return of the King,FRODO,You swore! You swore on the precious!
1064,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"Sauron fears you, Aragorn.He fears what you may become.And so he'll strike hard and fastat the world of Men.He will use his puppet Sarumanto destroy Rohan.War is coming.Rohan must defend itselfand therein lies our first challenge......for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.    ,The king's mind is enslavedit's an old device of Saruman's.His hold over King Theodenis now very strong.Sauron and Sarumanare tightening the noose.But for all their cunning......we have one advantage. The Ring remains hidden.And that we should seek to destroy it......has not yet enteredtheir darkest dreams. And so the weapon of the enemyis moving towards Mordor......in the hands of a Hobbit.Each day brings it closerto the fires of Mount Doom. We must trust now in Frodo.Everything depends upon speed......and the secrecy of his quest."
1065,The Two Towers,GANDALF,Do not regret your decision to leave him.Frodo must finish this task alone.
1066,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,He's not alone.Sam went with him.
1067,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"Did he?Did he, indeed? Good. Yes, very good."
1068,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,The Black Gate of Mordor.
1069,The Two Towers,SAM,"Oh, save us.My old Gaffer would have a thing or twoto say if he could see us now."
1070,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Master says to show himthe way into Mordor.So good Smeagol doesmaster says so.
1071,The Two Towers,FRODO,I did.
1072,The Two Towers,SAM,"That's it, then.We can't get past that."
1073,The Two Towers,SAM,Look!The gate.It's opening!I can see a way down.
1074,The Two Towers,FRODO,"Sam, no!"
1075,The Two Towers,EOWYN,"I made some stew.It isn't much, but it's hot."
1076,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Thank you. ,It's good."
1077,The Two Towers,EOWYN,Really?
1078,The Two Towers,EOWYN,"My uncle told me a strange thing.He said that you rode to warwith Thengel, my grandfather.But he must be mistaken."
1079,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,King Theoden has a good memory.He was only a small child at the time.
1080,The Two Towers,EOWYN,Then you must be at least 60.
1081,The Two Towers,EOWYN,Seventy?But you cannot be 80!
1082,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Eighty-seven.
1083,The Two Towers,EOWYN,You are one of the Dunedain.A descendant of Numenorblessed with long life.It was said that your racehad passed into legend.
1084,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,There are few of us left.The Northern Kingdomwas destroyed long ago.
1085,The Two Towers,EOWYN,"I'm sorry. Please, eat."
1086,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Did we lose him? I think we lost him.
1087,The Two Towers,ORC,I'm going to rip outyour filthy little innards!
1088,The Two Towers,ORC,Come here!
1089,The Two Towers,MERRY,Trees. Climb a tree.
1090,The Two Towers,GRIMA,What kind of devicecould bring down the wall?
1091,The Two Towers,SARUMAN,If the wall is breachedHelm's Deep will fall.
1092,The Two Towers,GRIMA,"Even if it is breached, it would takea number beyond reckoning......thousands, to storm the Keep."
1093,The Two Towers,SARUMAN,Tens of thousands.
1094,The Two Towers,GRIMA,"But, my lord, there is no such force."
1095,The Two Towers,SARUMAN,A new power is rising.Its victory is at hand.
1096,The Two Towers,SARUMAN,This night......the land will be stainedwith the blood of Rohan!March to Helm's Deep!Leave none alive!
1097,The Two Towers,SARUMAN,To war!
1098,The Two Towers,SARUMAN,There will be no dawn for Men.
1099,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Look. There's smoke to the south.
1100,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,There is always smoke rising......from lsengard these days.
1101,The Two Towers,MERRY,Isengard?
1102,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,There was a time......when Saruman would walk in my woods.But now he has a mind of metal......and wheels.He no longer cares for growing things.
1103,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,What is it?
1104,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,The eagles! The eagles are coming!
1105,The Return of the King,SAM,Frodo!
1106,The Return of the King,FRODO,I'm here Sam!
1107,The Return of the King,SAM,Destroy it!
1108,The Return of the King,SAM,Go on! Now! Throw it in the fire!
1109,The Return of the King,SAM,What are you waiting for? Just let it go!
1110,The Return of the King,FRODO,The Ring is mine!
1111,The Return of the King,SAM,No!
1112,The Return of the King,SAM,Nooooooo!
1113,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Yeees! , Yeees!    , Precious! My Precious!"
1114,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,They will hold.
1115,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"The Grey Pilgrim.     That's what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of Men I've walked     this earth, and now I have no time. With luck, my search will not be in     vain. ,Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to     the east."
1116,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Go.
1117,The Two Towers,ROHAN STABLEMAN,"That horse is half mad, my lord. There's nothing you can do. Leave him."
1118,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"F'ste, stille n',     f'ste, stille n'. Lac is drefed, gefr'gon."
1119,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Hw't nemna' 'e? Hm? Hw't nemna' 'e? (
1120,The Two Towers,EOWYN,His name is Brego. He     was my cousin's horse.
1121,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Brego. 'in nama is cynglic. (,)"
1122,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Man le trasta, Brego? Man cenich? (,)"
1123,The Two Towers,EOWYN,I have heard of the magic of Elves......but I did not look for it in a     Ranger from the North.You speak as one of their own.
1124,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,I was raised in Rivendell......for a time.Turn this fellow free. He's     seen enough of war.
1125,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,"Fifteen, sixteen."
1126,The Return of the King,EOWYN,Merry!
1127,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Legolas!
1128,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,"Thirty three, thirty four."
1129,The Return of the King,GIMLI,That still only counts as one!
1130,The Return of the King,ORC,"Come on then , come on!"
1131,The Return of the King,THEODEN,"I know your face, Eowyn. ,  My eyes darken."
1132,The Return of the King,EOWYN,"No, no.  I'm going to save you."
1133,The Return of the King,THEODEN,"You already did.  Eowyn, my body is broken.  You have to let me go."
1134,The Return of the King,FRODO,Smeagol promised!
1135,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,Smeagol lied!
1136,The Return of the King,SAM,AAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhhhh!
1137,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,AAAAAHH
1138,The Return of the King,SAM,", Frodo!"
1139,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Master!
1140,The Two Towers,FRODO,"I do not ask you to come with me, Sam."
1141,The Two Towers,SAM,"I know, Mr. Frodo.I doubt even these Elvish cloakswill hide us in there."
1142,The Two Towers,FRODO,Now!
1143,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"No!No! No, master!They catch you! They catch you!Don't take it to him.He wants the precious.Always he is looking for it.And the precious is wantingto go back to him.But we mustn't let him have it."
1144,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"No! , There's another way.More secret. A dark way."
1145,The Two Towers,SAM,Why haven't you spoken of this before?
1146,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Because master did not ask.
1147,The Two Towers,SAM,He's up to something.
1148,The Two Towers,FRODO,Are you saying there's another wayinto Mordor?
1149,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Yes. There's a path......and some stairs.And then......a tunnel.
1150,The Two Towers,FRODO,"He's led us this far, Sam."
1151,The Two Towers,SAM,"Mr. Frodo, no."
1152,The Two Towers,FRODO,He's been true to his word.
1153,The Two Towers,SAM,No.
1154,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Merry!
1155,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"Merry! ,  Merry it's me.    ,  It's Pippin!"
1156,The Return of the King,MERRY,I knew you'd find me.
1157,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Yes.
1158,The Return of the King,MERRY,Are you going to leave me?
1159,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"No Merry, I'm going to look after you."
1160,The Return of the King,GORBAG,"Hands off! That shiny shirt, that's mine!"
1161,The Two Towers,ARGORN,Their pace has quickened.They must have caught our scent.Hurry!
1162,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,"Come on, Gimli!"
1163,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Three days and nights pursuit.No food. No rest.And no sign of our quarrybut what bare rock can tell.
1164,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
1165,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,They may yet be alive.
1166,The Two Towers,ARGORN,Less than a day ahead of us. Come.
1167,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,"Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!"
1168,The Two Towers,GIMLI,I'm wasted on cross-country.We Dwarves are natural sprinters.Very dangerous over short distances.
1169,The Two Towers,MERRY,He's gone.
1170,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Merry!
1171,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,Hooom!
1172,The Two Towers,MERRY,Aaagh!

1174,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"Run, Merry!"
1175,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,Little Orcs.
1176,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"It's talking, Merry.The tree is talking."
1177,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,Tree?I am no tree!I am an Ent.
1178,The Two Towers,MERRY,A tree-herder.A shepherd of the forest.
1179,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"Don't talk to it, Merry.Don't encourage it!"
1180,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"Treebeard, some call me."
1181,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,And whose side are you on?
1182,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,Side?I am on nobody's side......because nobody's on my sidelittle Orc.Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
1183,The Two Towers,MERRY,We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!
1184,The Two Towers,GANDALF VOICE OVER,You cannot pass!
1185,The Two Towers,FRODO VOICE OVER,Gandalf!
1186,The Two Towers,GANDALF VOICE OVER,"I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.    Go back to the Shadow.The dark fire will not avail you,flame of Udun!"
1187,The Two Towers,GANDALF,You shall not pass!
1188,The Two Towers,BOROMIR ,No! No!
1189,The Two Towers,FRODO,Gandalf!
1190,The Two Towers,MERRY,It's Saruman's army.The war has started.

1197,The Return of the King,SAM,Yes Mr Frodo. It's over now.
1198,The Return of the King,FRODO,I can see the Shire. The Brandywine River. Bag End. Gandalf's fireworks. The     lights on the party tree.
1199,The Return of the King,SAM,"Rosie Cotton dancing. ,     She had ribbons in her hair. If ever I was to marry someone, it would have     been her. , It would've been her."
1200,The Return of the King,FRODO,I'm glad to be with you Samwise Gamgee here at the end of all things.     They hug.
1201,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"I am steward of the house of An'rion. Thus have I walked, and thus now I will sleep."
1202,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"Gondor is lost. There is no hope for men. , Why do the fools fly? Better to die sooner than late. For die we must."
1203,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long slow sleep of death embalmed. We shall burn like the heathen Kings of old. , Bring wood and oil."
1204,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Steady! Steady!
1205,The Return of the King,GANDALF,You are soldiers of Gondor. No matter what comes through that gate you will stand your ground.
1206,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Volley! , Fire!"
1207,The Return of the King,SAM,"Let him go, you filth! Let him go!"
1208,The Return of the King,SAM,"You will not touch him again! , Come on then, finish it!"
1209,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Keep breathing. That's the key.Breathe.
1210,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,They've run as if the very whipsof their masters were behind them.
1211,The Two Towers,ORC,We're not going no further......until we've had a breather.
1212,The Two Towers,UGLUK,Get a fire going!
1213,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Merry!Merry!
1214,The Two Towers,MERRY,"I think we might have made a mistakeleaving the Shire, Pippin."
1215,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,What's making that noise?
1216,The Two Towers,MERRY,It's the trees.
1217,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Peregrin Took my lad, there is a task now to be done.  Another     opportunity for one of the Shire folk to prove their great worth.     , You must not fail me."
1218,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,It's been very quiet across the river.
1219,The Return of the King,MADRIL,"The Orcs are lying low.  The garrison may have moved out.  We've sent     scouts to Cair Andros.  If the Orcs attack from the North, we'll have some     warning."
1220,The Return of the King,GOTHMOG,Quiet.
1221,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,We need 10 more.
1222,The Return of the King,EOWYN,No.
1223,The Return of the King,THEODEN,"I go to my fathers, in whose mighty company; I shall not now feel ashamed."
1224,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Eowyn.
1225,The Return of the King,KING OF THE DEAD,Release us!
1226,The Return of the King,GIMLI,"Bad idea!  Very handy in a tight spot these lads, despite the fact they're dead."
1227,The Return of the King,KING OF THE DEAD,You gave us your word!
1228,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,I hold your oath fulfilled.  Go.  Be at peace.

1232,The Two Towers,FRODO,"Lead the way, Smeagol."
1233,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Good Smeagol always helps.
1234,The Two Towers,MERRY,Hello?Treebeard?Where has he gone?
1235,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,I had the loveliest dream last night.There was this large barrelfull of pipe-weed.And we smoked all of it.And then......you were sick.I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
1236,The Two Towers,MERRY,Did you hear that?There it is again.Something's not right here.Not right at all.
1237,The Two Towers,MERRY,You just said something...Treeish.
1238,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"No, I didn't. I was just stretching."
1239,The Two Towers,MERRY,You're taller.
1240,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Who?
1241,The Two Towers,MERRY,You!
1242,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Than what?
1243,The Two Towers,MERRY,Than me!
1244,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,I've always been taller than you.
1245,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.You're the short one."
1246,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"Please, Merry.You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7"". ,3'8""!"
1247,The Return of the King,SHAGRAT,"It's going to the Great Eye, along with everything else."
1248,The Return of the King,GORBAG,I don't take orders from stinking Morgul-rats!
1249,The Return of the King,SHAGRAT,You touch it and I'll stick this blade in your gut!
1250,The Return of the King,GORBAG,The scum tried to knife me.  Kill him!
1251,The Return of the King,SAM,That's for Frodo!
1252,The Return of the King,SAM,And the Shire!
1253,The Return of the King,SAM,And that's for my old gaffer!
1254,The Return of the King,SHAGRAT,Stop your squealing you dunghill rat!
1255,The Return of the King,SHAGRAT,I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig!
1256,The Return of the King,SAM,Not if I stick you first!
1257,The Return of the King,FRODO,Sam!
1258,The Return of the King,FRODO,"Oh Sam, I'm so sorry.  Sorry for everything."
1259,The Return of the King,SAM,Let's get you out of here.
1260,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Rohan.Home of the Horse-lords.There's something strange at work here.Some evil gives speedto these creatures.Sets its will against us.
1261,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?
1262,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,The Uruks turn northeast.They are taking the Hobbits to lsengard.
1263,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Saruman.
1264,The Two Towers,SARUMAN VOICE OVER,The world is changing.Who now has the strength to standagainst the armies of Isengard......and Mordor?To stand against the might of Sauronand Saruman......and the union of the two towers?
1265,The Two Towers,SARUMAN VOICE OVER,"Together, my Lord Sauron...... we shall rule this Middle-earth."

1362,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Frodo has passed beyond my sight. ,  The darkness is deepening."
1363,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,If Sauron had the Ring we would know it.
1364,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"It's only a matter of time.  He has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping."
1365,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Let him stay there!  Let him rot!  Why should we care?
1366,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Because 10,000 Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom."

1373,The Two Towers,WILDMAN,Murderers!

1390,The Two Towers,FRODO,Who are you?
1391,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Mustn't ask us. Not its business.Gollum. Gollum.
1392,The Return of the King,SAM,It must be getting near teatime. Leastways it would be in decent places     where there is still teatime.
1393,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,We're not in decent places.
1394,The Return of the King,SAM,Mr Frodo?  What is it?
1395,The Return of the King,FRODO,It's just a feeling.  I don't think I'll be coming back.
1396,The Return of the King,SAM,Yes you will.  Of course you will.  That's just morbid thinking.  We're     going there and back again just like Mr Bilbo.  You'll see.
1397,The Return of the King,FRODO,I think these lands were once part of the Kingdom of Gondor.
1398,The Return of the King,FRODO,"Long ago, when there was a King."
1399,The Return of the King,SAM,"Mr Frodo, look!  The King has got a crown again."

1413,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,"Well!  Here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily! I     have the eyes of a hawk, and ears of a fox!"
1414,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,Oh!

1421,The Two Towers,FRODO,We can't leave this here for someoneto follow us down.
1422,The Two Towers,SAM,"Who's gonna follow us down hereMr. Frodo?It's a shame, really.Lady Galadriel gave me that.Real Elvish rope.    Well, there's nothing for it.It's one of my knots.Won't come free in a hurry."

1424,The Two Towers,SAM,"Mordor. The one place in Middle-earthwe don't want to see any closer.And it's the one placewe're trying to get to.It's just where we can't get.    Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.I don't think Gandalf meant for us tocome this way."
1425,The Two Towers,FRODO,"He didn't mean for a lot of thingsto happen, Sam......but they did."
1426,The Two Towers,SAM,"Mr. Frodo?It's the Ring, isn't it?"
1427,The Two Towers,FRODO,It's getting heavier.

1451,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"Gandalf! , Where's     Gandalf? , GANDALF!"
1452,The Two Towers,SNAGA,Just a mouthful......a bit of the flank.
1453,The Two Towers,UGLUK,Looks like meat's back on the menuboys.
1454,The Two Towers,MERRY,Pippin.Let's go.
1455,The Two Towers,GRISHNAKH,Go on.Call for help. Squeal.No one's going to save you now.
1456,The Two Towers,MERRY,Pippin!
1457,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Aaaaaaaagh!
1458,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,A red sun rises.Blood has been spilled this night.
1459,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Riders of Rohan......what news from the Mark?
1460,The Two Towers,EOMER,"What business does an Elf, a Manand a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?Speak quickly!"
1461,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"Give me your name, horse-masterand I shall give you mine."
1462,The Two Towers,EOMER,"I would cut off your head, Dwarf......if it stood but a little higherfrom the ground."
1463,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,You would die before your stroke fell.
1464,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.This is Gimli, son of Gloinand Legolas of the Woodland Realm.We are friends of Rohanand of Theoden, your king."
1465,The Two Towers,EOMER,"Theoden no longer recognizesfriend from foe. Not even his own kin. ,Saruman has poisoned the mindof the king......and claimed lordship over these lands.    My company are those loyal to Rohan.And for that, we are banished.The White Wizard is cunning.He walks here and there, they say......as an old man hooded and cloaked.And everywhere, his spiesslip past our nets."
1466,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,Very good sir.
1467,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Gamling.
1468,The Return of the King,GAMLING,My lord!
1469,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Make haste across the Riddermark.  Summon every able-bodied man to     Dunharrow.
1470,The Return of the King,GAMLING,I will.
1471,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Do you ride with us?
1472,The Return of the King,EOWYN,"Just to the encampment.  It's tradition for the women of the court to     farewell the men.  ,         The men have found their captain.  They will follow you into battle.  Even     to death.  You have given us hope."
1473,The Return of the King,MERRY,"Excuse me!  , I have     a sword.  Please accept it!  , I offer you my service Theoden King."
1474,The Return of the King,THEODEN,"And gladly, I accept it.  ,      You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan."
1475,The Return of the King,GIMLI,"Horse men!  I wish I could muster an army of Dwarves, fully armed and     filthy."
1476,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war.  I fear war already     marches on their own lands.
1477,The Return of the King,THEODEN,
1478,The Return of the King,EOMER,"Now is the hour,     Riders of Rohan.  Oaths you have taken.  Now fulfil them all, to Lord and     Land!  Hah!"
1479,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Why are there so few of youwhen you have lived so long? Are there Ent children?
1480,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,Bru-ra-hroom.There have been no Entingsfor a terrible long count of years.
1481,The Two Towers,MERRY,Why is that?
1482,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,We lost the Entwives.
1483,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"Oh, I'm sorry. How did they die?"
1484,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,Die? No.We lost them.And now we cannot find them. I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
1485,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Can't say that I have. You, Pip?"
1486,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,What do they     look like?
1487,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,I don't remember now.
1488,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. There dwells Theoden,     King of Rohan...... whose mind is overthrown. Saruman's hold over King     Theoden is now very strong."
1489,The Two Towers,EOWYN,"My lord, your son......he is dead. , My lord? Uncle? Will you not go to him? Will you do     nothing?"
1490,The Two Towers,GANDALF,Be careful what you say.Do not look for welcome here.
1491,The Two Towers,GRIMA,"Oh, he must have died sometime in the night. What a tragedy     for the king......to lose his only son and heir."
1492,The Return of the King,GANDALF,I've sent him to his death.
1493,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,No.  There is still hope for Frodo.  He needs time and safe passage across the plains of    Gorgoroth.  We can give him that.
1494,The Return of the King,GIMLI,How?
1495,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Draw out Sauron's armies.  Empty his lands.   Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate.
1496,The Return of the King,EOMER,We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.
1497,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Not for ourselves.  But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's eye fixed upon us.   Keep him blind to all else that moves.
1498,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,A diversion.
1499,The Return of the King,GIMLI,"Certainty of death, small chance of success, what are we waiting for?"
1500,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Sauron will suspect a trap.  He will not take the bait.
1501,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"Oh, I think he will."
1502,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"Long have you hunted me.  Long have I eluded you.  No more! ,  Behold, the Sword of Elendil!"
1503,The Two Towers,EOTHAIN,"Yes, Mama."
1504,The Two Towers,FREDA,"I don't want to leave.I don't want to go, Mama."
1505,The Two Towers,MORWEN,"Freda, I will find     you there."
1506,The Two Towers,MORWEN,"Quickly! ,Go, child."
1507,The Two Towers,SARUMAN VOICE OVER,"Rohan, my lord......is ready to fall."
1508,The Two Towers,EOMER,Theodred.Find the king's son!
1509,The Two Towers,ROHAN HORSEMAN,Mordor will pay for this
1510,The Two Towers,EOMER,These Orcs are not from Mordor.
1511,The Two Towers,ROHAN HORSEMAN,"My Lord Eomer, over here!"
1512,The Two Towers,EOMER,He's alive.
1513,The Two Towers,EOWYN,Theodred.
1514,The Two Towers,EOWYN,"Your son is badly wounded, my lord."
1515,The Two Towers,EOMER,He was ambushed by Orcs.If we don't defend our countrySaruman will take it by force
1516,The Two Towers,GRIMA,That is a lie.Saruman the White has ever beenour friend and ally.
1517,The Two Towers,FRODO,Gandalf told me you wereone of the river-folk.
1518,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Cold be heart and hand and boneCold be travellers far from home
1519,The Two Towers,FRODO,He said your life was a sad story.
1520,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,They do not see what lies aheadWhen sun has failed and moon is dead
1521,The Two Towers,FRODO,You were not so very differentfrom a Hobbit once.Were you?Smeagol.

1533,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Come on, Hobbits!  Mustn't stop now.   This way!"
1534,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.  ,  I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any     fighting,   do they?"
1535,The Return of the King,GANDALF,You're in the service of the steward now.  You'll have to do as you are     told Peregrin Took.
1536,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Ridiculous Hobbit!  Guard of the Citadel!

1539,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Yes.
1540,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,It's so quiet.
1541,The Return of the King,GANDALF,It's the deep breath before the plunge.
1542,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"I don't want to be in a battle.  But waiting on the edge of one I can't     escape is even worse. , Is     there any hope Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?"
1543,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"There never was much hope.  Just a fool's hope.  , Our enemy is ready.      His full strength's gathered.   Not only orcs, but men as well    ,  Legions of Haradrim from     the South, mercenaries from the coast ,     All will answer Mordor's call."

1579,The Two Towers,FRODO,It's because we've been here before.We're going in circles.
1580,The Two Towers,SAM,What is that horrid stink?I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it?
1581,The Two Towers,FRODO,Yes.....I can smell it.................We're not alone.

1588,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,No!That would kill us! Kill us!
1589,The Two Towers,SAM,It's no more than you deserve!
1590,The Two Towers,FRODO,"Maybe he does deserve to die.But now that I see him, I do pity him."
1591,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,We be nice to themif they be nice to us.Take it off us.We swears to do what you wants................We swears.
1592,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,"Mr Frodo ? , Frodo! Frodo!     , I thought I'd lost you"
1593,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,What are you talking about ?
1594,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,It's just something Gandalf said.
1595,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,What did he say?
1596,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,The Fellowship awaits the Ringbearer.
1597,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,"Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right ?"

1599,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF VOICEOVER,"We must hold this course west of the Misty Mountains for     forty days. If our luck holds the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us.    , and there are     road turns east to Mordor."

1604,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,"If     anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note that they're not, I'd say     that we were taking the long way round. Gandalf, we could pass through the     Mines of Moria.  My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome."
1605,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"No Gimli, I would not take the road through Moria unless I     had no other choice."
1606,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,ARGH!

1618,The Fellowship of the Ring,ARWEN,I choose a mortal life
1619,The Fellowship of the Ring,ARAGORN,You cannot give me this
1620,The Fellowship of the Ring,ARWEN,It is mine to give to whom I will.  Like my heart

1624,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,We are no spies.We track a party of Uruk-haiwestward across the plain.They have taken two of our friendscaptive.
1625,The Two Towers,EOMER,The Uruks are destroyed.We slaughtered them during the night.
1626,The Two Towers,GIMLI,But there were two Hobbits.Did you see two Hobbits with them?
1627,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,They would be small.Only children to your eyes.
1628,The Two Towers,EOMER,We left none alive.We piled the carcasses and burned them.
1629,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Dead?
1630,The Two Towers,EOMER,I am sorry.

1633,The Two Towers,GIMLI,It's one of their wee belts.
1634,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,Hiro hyn h'dh'     ab 'wanath...
1635,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Aaaaagh!
1636,The Two Towers,GRIMA,I understand. His passing is hard to accept. Especially now     that your brother has deserted you.
1637,The Two Towers,EOWYN,"Leave me alone, snake!"
1638,The Two Towers,GRIMA,"Oh, but you are alone. Who knows what you've spoken to the     darkness ,......in     the bitter watches of the night......when all your life seems to shrink. The     walls of your bower closing in about you. A hutch to trammel some wild thing     in.    ,So fair. So cold. Like a morning of pale spring......still clinging     to winter's chill."
1639,The Two Towers,EOWYN,Your words are poison.
1640,The Two Towers,GIMLI,You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
1641,The Two Towers,HAMA,"I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf     Greyhame. By order of Grima Wormtongue."
1642,The Two Towers,HAMA,Your staff
1643,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"Hmmm ,You     would not part an old man from his walking stick."
1644,The Two Towers,GRIMA,"My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. He's a herald of woe."
1645,The Two Towers,GANDALF,The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late......Theoden     King.
1646,The Two Towers,GRIMA,He's     not welcome.
1647,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Why should I welcome you......Gandalf Stormcrow?
1648,The Two Towers,GRIMA,"A just question, my liege. ,Late is the hour......in which this     conjurer chooses to appear., Lathspell I name him.Ill news is an ill guest."
1649,The Two Towers,GANDALF,Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. I have     not passed through fire and death......to bandy crooked words with a witless     worm.
1650,The Two Towers,GRIMA,His staff. I     told you to take the wizard's staff.
1651,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"Grima.Grima.,Grima."

1653,The Two Towers,GRIMA,Why do you lay these troubleson an already troubled mind?Can you not see?Your uncle is weariedby your malcontent......your warmongering.
1654,The Two Towers,EOMER,"Warmongering?,How long is it sinceSaruman bought you?What was the promised price, Grima?When all the Men are deadyou will take your share of the treasure?"
1655,The Two Towers,EOMER,Too long have you watched my sister.Too long have you haunted her steps.
1656,The Two Towers,GRIMA,"You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund."
1657,The Two Towers,GRIMA,Too much.You are banished forthwithfrom the kingdom of Rohan......and all its domainsunder pain of death.
1658,The Two Towers,EOMER,You have no authority here.Your orders mean nothing.
1659,The Two Towers,GRIMA,This order does not come from me.It comes from the king.He signed it this morning.
1660,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"Dead?No, you cannot kill them. No."
1661,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Wraiths!Wraiths on wings!They are calling for it.They are calling for the precious.
1662,The Two Towers,SAM,Mr. Frodo! It's all right.I'm here.

1674,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"This will be the end of Gondor as we know it.    Here the hammer stroke     will fall hardest.  ,  If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath     falls, the last defence of this city will be gone."
1675,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,But we have the white wizard.  That's got to count for something.
1676,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Gandalf?
1677,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Sauron has yet to show his deadliest servant.     ,      The one who will lead Mordor's army in war.  , The one they say no living man can kill.    ,     The Witch King of Angmar.

1722,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"and the Ring ? , You feel its power growing don't you. I've felt it     too.  You must be careful now.  Evil will be drawn to you from     outside the Fellowship and I fear from within."
1723,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Who then do I trust ?
1724,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,You must trust to yourself. Trust your own strength.
1725,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,What do you mean ?
1726,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,There are many powers in this world for good or for evil.      Some are greater than I am and against some I have not yet been tested

1728,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,Dwarf doors are invisible when closed

1732,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"It reads ""The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria, Speak Friend     and Enter"""
1733,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,What do you suppose that means ?

2004,The Return of the King,ARWEN,"If I leave him now, I will regret it forever. It is time."
2005,The Return of the King,ARWEN,"From the ashes of fire shall be woken,     A light from the shadow shall spring,     Renewed shall be blade that was broken,         The crownless again shall be king."
2006,The Return of the King,ARWEN,Reforge the sword' ada.
2007,The Return of the King,ELROND,Your hands are cold. The life of the Eldar is leaving you.
2008,The Return of the King,ARWEN,"This was my choice. Ada, whether by your will or not there is no ship     now that can bear me hence."
2009,The Return of the King,GANDALF,We have just passed into the realm of Gondor.
2010,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Minas Tirith. City of Kings.
2011,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"It's the tree! Gandalf, Gandalf."
2012,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Yes the white tree of Gondor. The tree of the King. Lord Denethor     however, is not the King. He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne."
2013,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Now listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir's father. To give him     news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise. And do not mention     Frodo or the Ring. And say nothing of Aragorn either. In fact, its better if     you don't speak at all Peregrin Took."
2014,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Hail Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor."
2015,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,A Ring!
2016,The Fellowship of the Ring,GOLLUM,"Lost!    , My Precious is lost."
2017,The Fellowship of the Ring,GALADRIEL,For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the     fortunes of all.
2018,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"The 22nd day of September in the year 1400    ,by Shire     reckoning. , Bag End,     Bagshot Row, Hobbiton, West Farthing, The Shire, Middle Earth.    , The Third Age of this world."
2019,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"There and back again, A Hobbit's tale, by Bilbo     Baggins. ,Now, where to begin?     Ah, yes. ,Concerning Hobbits."
2020,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO VOICEOVER,"Hobbits have been living and farming in the four     Farthings of the Shire for many hundreds of years. , quite content to     ignore and be ignored by the world of the Big Folk. , Middle Earth being,     after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Hobbits must seem of     little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted     amongst the very wise."
2021,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Frodo, someone at     the door. ,In fact, it     has been remarked by some that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.    , A rather unfair observation    , As     we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales    ,and the smoking of pipeweed. , But where     our hearts truly lie , is in peace and quiet ,and good     tilled earth. ,For all Hobbits share a love of all things that grow.    ,And yes, no doubt to others, our ways seem quaint    , But today of all days, it is brought home to me it is     no bad thing to celebrate a simple life."
2022,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Frodo, the door! ,     sticklebacks, where is that boy! FRODO!"
2023,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"Hmm hmm hmm hmm, Down from the door where it began, hmm     hmm hmm hmm"
2024,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"And I must follow if I can. , The road goes     ever on and on, down from the door where it began, now far ahead the road     has gone, and I must follow if I can."

2029,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,No news of Frodo?
2030,The Return of the King,GANDALF,No word. Nothing.
2031,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,We have time. Every day Frodo moves closer to Mordor.
2032,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Do we know that?
2033,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,What does your     heart tell you?
2034,The Return of the King,GANDALF,That Frodo is alive.     Yes' yes he's alive.
2035,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Too risky. Too risky. ,Thieves. They stole it from us. Kill them, kill them, kill them both!    ,"
2036,The Return of the King,SMEAGOL,No!
2037,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Sshh, quiet, mustn't wake them. Mustn't ruin it now."
2038,The Return of the King,SMEAGOL,"But they knows, ,     they knows, they suspects us!"
2039,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"What's it saying my precious, my love? Is Smeagol losing his nerve?"
2040,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,"Soon Mr Elf, you will enjoy the fabelled hospitality of the     dwarves. Roaring fires! Malt Beer! Red Meat off the bone!"
2041,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,This my friend is the home of my cousin Balin and they call     it a Mine!
2042,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,A Mine!
2043,The Fellowship of the Ring,BOROMIR,"This isn't     a mine, it's a tomb"
2044,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,Nooooo!     NOOOOOOOOOOoooooooo!
2045,The Fellowship of the Ring,LEGOLAS,Goblins!
2046,The Fellowship of the Ring,BOROMIR,We make for the gap of Rohan.  We should never have     come here
2047,The Fellowship of the Ring,BOROMIR,Now get out of here! Get out!

2049,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Hello, Pip."
2050,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,You're hurt.
2051,The Two Towers,MERRY,I'm fine. lt was just an act.
2052,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,An act?
2053,The Two Towers,MERRY,"See? I fooled you too.Don't worry about me, Pippin."
2054,The Two Towers,UGLUK,What is it? What do you smell?
2055,The Two Towers,URUK HAI,Man-flesh

2057,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Aragorn.
2058,The Two Towers,UGLUK,Let's move!
2059,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,That black rider was looking for something. Or someone (he     walks up to Frodo and looks him in the face) Frodo ?
2060,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,Get down!
2061,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,"I have to leave the Shire. ,Sam and I must get to Bree"
2062,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,Right. Bucklebury     Ferry.  Follow me.

2072,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Let the Ringbearer decide
2073,The Fellowship of the Ring,BOROMIR,"We cannot stay here! ,This will be the death of the     hobbits!"
2074,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Frodo ?
2075,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,We will go through     the Mines
2076,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,So be it
2077,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"Strong?! ,Oh, that's good."
2078,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.Merry and Pippin are quite safe.In fact, they are far saferthan you are about to be."
2079,The Two Towers,GIMLI,This new Gandalf's more grumpythan the old one.
2080,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,That is one of the Mearas......unless my eyes are cheatedby some spell.
2081,The Two Towers,GANDALF,Shadowfax.He is the lord of all horses......and has been my friendthrough many dangers.
2082,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,
2083,The Two Towers,MERRY,ls it much further?
2084,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.You might call it far, perhaps.My home lies deep in the forest......near the roots of the mountain.I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.And safe is where I'll keep you.I believe you will enjoy this next one too. ,It's one of my own compositions.Right."
2085,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"Sleep, little Shirelings.Heed no nightly noise.Sleep till morning light.I have business in the forest.There are many to call.Many that must come. ,The Shadow lies on Fangorn.The withering of all woodsis drawing near."
2086,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Mordor!
2087,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,In the common tongue it says
2088,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,Done!
2089,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,You're supposed to stick it in the ground
2090,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,It is in the ground
2091,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,Outside
2092,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,It was your idea!
2093,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Bilbo! Bilbo!  Watch out for the dragon
2094,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Dragon! Nonsense, there hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand     years."
2095,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,That was good!
2096,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,Lets get another one!
2097,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took! I might have known!
2098,The Fellowship of the Ring,CROWD,Speech Bilbo
2099,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Speech!
2100,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"My dear Bagginses and Boffins, , Tooks and Brandybucks ,, Grubbs ,, Chubbs    ,, Hornblowers ,, Bulgers ,,     Bracegirdles ,, and Proudfoots"
2101,The Fellowship of the Ring,PROUDFOOT HOBBIT,PROUDFEET!
2102,The Return of the King,GANDALF,I come with tidings in this dark hour and with counsel.
2103,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,Perhaps you come to explain this.
2104,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,Perhaps you have come to tell me why my son is dead.
2105,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Boromir died to save us my kinsman and me. He fell defending us from     many foes.
2106,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Pippin.
2107,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"I offer you my service, such as it is in payment of this debt."
2108,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,This is my first command to you. How did you escape and my son did not?     So mighty as man as he was.
2109,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow and Boromir was pierced by     many.
2110,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Get up!
2111,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir but it is not now.     War is coming. The enemy is on your doorstep. As steward, you are charged     with the defence of this city. Where are Gondor's armies? You still have     friends. You are not alone in this fight. Send word to Theoden of Rohan.     Light the beacons."
2112,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"You think you are wise Mithrandir. Yet for all your subtleties you have     not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen     more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against     Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me. I know who rides     with Theoden of Rohan. Oh yes, word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son     of Arathorn. And I tell you now. I will not bow to this Ranger from the     North. Last of a ragged house long bereft of Lordship."
2113,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King, steward."
2114,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,The rule of Gondor is mine and no others!
2115,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Come!
2116,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"All had turned to vain ambition. He would use even his grief as a cloak!     A thousand years this city has stood and now at the whim of a madman it will     fall! And the white tree, the tree of the King will never bloom again."
2117,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"A wizard is never late! Frodo Baggins.    , Nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means     to."
2118,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Its wonderful to see you Gandalf.
2119,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,You didn't think Id miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?
2120,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,So how is the old rascal? I hear it is going to be a     party of special significance?
2121,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,You know Bilbo he's got the whole place in an uproar.
2122,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Well that should please him.
2123,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Half the Shire's been invited.     And the rest of them are turning up anyway.
2124,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO VOICEOVER,"And so life in the Shire goes on, very much as it has     this past age. , Full of its own comings and goings with change coming     slowly, if it comes at all. ,For things are made to endure in     the Shire, passing from one generation to the next. There's always been a     Baggins living here under the Hill, in Bag End"
2125,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,And there always will be.
2126,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,"To tell you the truth, Bilbo has been acting a bit odd     lately. ,I     mean, more than usual. He's taken to locking himself in his study.    , He spends hours     and hours poring over old maps when he thinks I'm not looking."
2127,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,Where's it gone?
2128,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,Aaaaah.
2129,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,"He's up to something. , All right then,     keep your secrets!"
2130,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,What?
2131,The Return of the King,SMEAGOL,No! No! Never! Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses. Smeagol wants to see them'. Dead!
2132,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"And we will! Smeagol did it once, he can do it again!     ,     Its ours! Ours!"
2133,The Return of the King,SMEAGOL,We must get the precious! We must get it back!
2134,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,Patience! Patience my love! First we must lead them to her!
2135,The Return of the King,SMEAGOL,We lead them to the winding stair.
2136,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Yes, the stairs and then?"
2137,The Return of the King,SMEAGOL,"Up, up, up the stairs we go until we come to the tunnel."
2138,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"And when they go in, there's no coming out. She's always hungry. She     always needs to' feed. She must eat. All she gets is filthy Orcses."
2139,The Return of the King,SMEAGOL,"And they doesn't taste very nice, does they Precious?"
2140,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"No, not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats.    ,     Hobbit meat. And when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes     , then we will find it."
2141,The Return of the King,SMEAGOL,And take it for Meee!
2142,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,For us.
2143,The Return of the King,SMEAGOL,"Yes, we meant for us! Gollum, gollum. The precious will be ours once the Hobbitses are dead!"
2144,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY AND PIPPIN,Frodo! Frodo!
2145,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,"Strider! , Get off him!"
2146,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,Aragorn!
2147,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,Frodo!
2148,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Strider!
2149,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Into the Mines!
2150,The Fellowship of the Ring,BOROMIR,Legolas!
2151,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"We now have but one choice, we must face the long dark of     Moria.  Be on your guard, there are older and fouler things than orcs     in the deep places of the world"
2152,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"The wealth of Moria is not in gold, or jewels, but Mithril"
2153,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him
2154,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,Aww that was a Kingly gift
2155,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"Yes.  I never told him, but its worth was greater than     the value of The Shire!"
2156,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,Pippin!
2157,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,I've no memory of this place
2158,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,Are we lost ?
2159,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,Frodo! Come on!
2160,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,Frodo!
2161,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,Come on faster!
2162,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,How far to the nearest crossing ?
2163,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,"The Brandywine Bridge, twenty miles."
2164,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Come on!
2165,The Fellowship of the Ring,GATEKEEPER,What do you want ?
2166,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,We're heading for the Prancing Pony.
2167,The Fellowship of the Ring,GATEKEEPR,Hobbits! Four hobbits!  What's more out of     The Shire by your talk!  What business brings you to Bree?
2168,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,We wish to at the Inn.  Our business is our own.
2169,The Fellowship of the Ring,GATEKEEPER,"alright young sir, I     meant no offence. ,My job to ask questions after nightfall. There's talk of strange folk     abroad. Can't be too careful"
2170,The Fellowship of the Ring,MAN,Out of the way! Watch where you're walking!
2171,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Excuse me ?
2172,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,Today is my One Hundred and Eleventh birthday!
2173,The Fellowship of the Ring,HOBBIT,Happy Birthday!
2174,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Alas, elevnty-one years is far too short a time to live     among such excellent and admirable hobbits.,  I don't know half of you half as well as I     should like and I like less than half of you, half as well as you deserve."
2175,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Why are they still guarding it?
2176,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one     day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once     was before it fell into decay. ,     The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken. Kings made tombs more     splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their     descent , dearer than the names of their sons.    ,     Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers     asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.    ,     The line of Kings failed. The white tree withered. The rule of Gondor was     given over to lesser men."
2177,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Mordor.
2178,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Yes, there it lies. This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow."
2179,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,A storm is coming.
2180,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"This is not the weather of the world. This is a device of Sauron's     making. A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have     no love of daylight, so he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage     along the road to war. When the shadow of Mordor reaches this city it will     begin."
2181,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"Well' Minas Tirith' very impressive. ,So where are off to next?"
2182,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Oh, it's too late for that Peregrin. There's no leaving this city.    ,     Help must come to us."
2183,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,But I know you have something to do with it.
2184,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Good gracious me!
2185,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Before you came along we Bagginses were very well     thought of.
2186,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Indeed?
2187,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,"We never had any adventures, or did anything     unexpected."
2188,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I     was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the     door."
2189,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,"Whatever you did, you've been officially labelled as a     'disturber of the peace.'"
2190,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Oh really?
2191,The Fellowship of the Ring,CHILDREN HOBBITS,Gandalf! Gandalf!
2192,The Fellowship of the Ring,CHILDREN HOBBITS,Fireworks Gandalf! Gandalf! Fireworks Gandalf!
2193,The Fellowship of the Ring,CHILDREN HOBBITS,Hooooraaaay!
2194,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,"Gandalf, I'm glad you're back."
2195,The Return of the King,SAM,You treacherous little toad!
2196,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"No, no! Master!"
2197,The Return of the King,FRODO,No Sam! Leave him alone!
2198,The Return of the King,SAM,I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us.
2199,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly! ,     Aaaagh he is a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol and who makes up nasty lies!"
2200,The Return of the King,SAM,You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!
2201,The Return of the King,FRODO,Sam!
2202,The Return of the King,SAM,Call me a liar? You're a liar!
2203,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,Waaaah!
2204,The Return of the King,FRODO,If you scare him off then we are lost!
2205,The Return of the King,SAM,I don't care! I can't do it Mr Frodo! I won't wait around for him to     kill us!
2206,The Return of the King,FRODO,I'm not sending him away.
2207,The Return of the King,SAM,You don't see it do you? He's a villain.
2208,The Return of the King,FRODO,We can't do this by ourselves Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my     side.
2209,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,No
2210,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,I think we are
2211,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,Ssh! Gandalf's thinking
2212,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,Merry!
2213,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,What!
2214,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,I'm hungry
2215,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,There's something down there
2216,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,It's Gollum
2217,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Gollum!
2218,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,He's been following us for three days
2219,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,He escaped the dungeons of Barad-D'r!
2220,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"Escaped ,     or was set loose and now the Ring has drawn him here ,      He won't ever be rid of his need for it.  He hates and loves the Ring,     as he hates and loves himself.  Smeagol's life is a sad story    ,  Yes    , he was once called, before the Ring     found him. Before it drove him mad"
2221,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,It's a pity Bilbo didnt kill him when he had the chance
2222,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"Pity ?  It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.      Many that live deserve death and many that die, deserve life. Can you give     it to them Frodo ? Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgement Even     the very wise cannot see all ends.  My heart tells me that Gollum has     some part to play, yet for good or ill.... before this is over.     ,     The pity of Bilbo, may rule the fate of many"
2223,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,I wish the Ring had never come to me.  I wish none of     this had happened.
2224,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for     them to decide.  All we have to decide is what to do with the time that     is given to us.  There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo,     besides the will of evil.  Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which     case you also were meant to have it and that is an encouraging thought.        Oh! Its that way"
2225,The Fellowship of the Ring,BARLIMAN,"Good Evening little masters.  What can I do for you ?     If you're looking for accomodation, we've got some nice, cosy hobbit sized     rooms available.  Always proud to cater to the little folk, Mr err... ?"
2226,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,"Underhill, my name's     Underhill"
2227,The Fellowship of the Ring,BARLIMAN,"Underhill , yes.."
2228,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,We're friends of Gandalf the Grey. Can you tell him we've     arrived?
2229,The Fellowship of the Ring,BARLIMAN,"Gandalf ?  ,Gandalf ? Oh yes!  I remember!  Elderly chap! Big grey     beard, pointy hat.  , Not seen     him for six months."
2230,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,What do we do now ?
2231,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Sam. He'll be here.  He'll come.
2232,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,What's that ?
2233,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,"This my friend, is a pint!"
2234,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,It comes in pints ?
2235,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,hmmmhmmm
2236,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,I'm getting one!
2237,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,You've had a whole half already!
2238,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we     arrived!
2239,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"So am I dear boy. , So am I."
2240,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"No thank     you! We don't want any more visitors, well wishers or distant relations!"
2241,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,And what about very old friends?
2242,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,Gandalf?
2243,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Bilbo Baggins.
2244,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,My dear Gandalf!
2245,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"It's good to see you. One hundred and eleven years old     who would believe it. ,     You haven't aged a day!"
2246,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome. Oh, here we are."
2247,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Tea or maybe something a little stronger? I've got a     few bottles of the Old Winyard left, 1296, a very good year, almost as old     as I am."
2248,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"It was laid down by my father, what say we open one eh?"
2249,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"Just tea, thank you."
2250,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Owwwh!
2251,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,I was expecting you sometime last week. Not that it     matters; you come and go as you please. Always have done and always will.
2252,The Return of the King,SAM,I'm on your side Mr Frodo
2253,The Return of the King,FRODO,"I know Sam, I know. Trust me. Come Smeagol."
2254,The Return of the King,EOWYN,What time is it?
2255,The Return of the King,EOWYN,"I dreamed I saw a great wave climbing over green lands and above the     hills. I stood upon the brink. It was utterly dark in the abyss before my     feet. A light shone behind me but I could not turn ,     I could only stand there, waiting."
2256,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Night changes many thoughts. Sleep Eowyn. Sleep while you can.
2257,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,"The stars are veiled. Something stirs in the East, a sleepless malice , The eye of the enemy     is moving."
2258,The Return of the King,MERRY,What are you doing?
2259,The Return of the King,MERRY,Pippin!
2260,The Return of the King,MERRY,Pippin!
2261,The Return of the King,MERRY,Pippin! Are you mad?
2262,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"I just want to look at it, just one more time."
2263,The Return of the King,MERRY,Put it back!
2264,The Return of the King,MERRY,Pippin!
2265,The Return of the King,MERRY,No!
2266,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,He's remembered
2267,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"No, but the air doesnt smell so foul down here.  If in doubt, Meriadoc,     always follow your nose."
2268,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"Let me risk a little more light , Behold the     great realm and dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf."
2269,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,There's an eye-opener and no mistake
2270,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,Oh!
2271,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Gimli!
2272,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,"No, no , no"
2273,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"Here lies Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of Moria.    ,  He is dead then.    ,  Its as I feared."
2274,The Fellowship of the Ring,LEGOLAS,"We must move on,     we cannot linger."
2275,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"They have taken the Bridge and the second hall.  We have barred the     gates, but cannot hold them for long.  The ground shakes.  Drums    ,     Drums in the deep. We cannot get out. , A shadow moves in the dark.    , We cannot get out. They are     coming."
2276,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"Fool of a     Took!  ,  Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your     stupidity!"
2277,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,Frodo!
2278,The Fellowship of the Ring,LEGOLAS,Orcs!
2279,The Fellowship of the Ring,ARAGORN,Get back! and     stay close to Gandalf.
2280,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Excuse me. That man in the corner.  Who is he ?
2281,The Fellowship of the Ring,BARLIMAN,"He's one of them rangers. They're dangerous folk they are.      Wandering the wilds.  What his right name is, I've never heard, but     round here, he's known as Strider."
2282,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Strider
2283,The Fellowship of the Ring,RING,Baggins.... Baggins.... Baggins ....Baggins!  Baggins!
2284,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,"Baggins ?  Sure I know a Baggins!  He's over     there.  Frodo Baggins! He's my second cousin once removed on his     mother's side , and my     third cousin twice removed on his father's side, if you follow me."
2285,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Pippin!
2286,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,Steady on!
2287,The Fellowship of the Ring,MEN,Oh!
2288,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAURON VOICE,"You cannot hide!  , I see you!    ,There     is no life in the void , Only death!"
2289,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,You draw far too much attention to yourself Mr Underhill!
2290,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,What do you want ?
2291,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,A little more caution from you!  That is no trinket     you carry!
2292,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,I carry nothing
2293,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,"Indeed , I can avoid being seen if I wish.      But to disappear entirely     That is a rare gift!"
2294,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"You've caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid urm we've     only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle oh and there's some cheese here,     oh no that wont do! Urm we've got raspberry jam, an apple tart    ,     but we've not much for afters. Oh no we're all right, I've found some sponge     cake! , I can make     you some eggs if you ' oh'. Gandalf?"
2295,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"Just tea, thank you."
2296,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Oh right. ,     You don't mind if I do, do you?"
2297,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Oh not at all!
2298,The Fellowship of the Ring,VOICE,Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!
2299,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"I'm not at     home! , It's the Sackville-Bagginses."
2300,The Fellowship of the Ring,VOICE,I know you're in there!
2301,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"They're after the house! , They've never forgiven me for living this     long. I've got to get away from these confounded relatives hanging on the     bell all day, never giving me a moment's peace. , I want to see     mountains again, mountains Gandalf. , And     then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea!"
2302,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,So you mean to go through with your plan then?
2303,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Yes, yes, it's all in hand. All the arrangements are     made. , Oh, thank you."
2304,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Frodo suspects something.
2305,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Of course he does, he's a Baggins, not some blockheaded     Bracegirdle from Hardbottle."
2306,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,You will tell him wont you?
2307,The Return of the King,MERRY,Pippin!
2308,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,He is here!
2309,The Return of the King,SAURON,I see you!
2310,The Return of the King,MERRY,Pippin!
2311,The Return of the King,MERRY,Help! Gandalf help!
2312,The Return of the King,MERRY,Help him!
2313,The Return of the King,MERRY,Pippin!
2314,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Fool of a Took!
2315,The Return of the King,GANDALF,No.
2316,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Look at me.
2317,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"Gandalf, forgive me!"
2318,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Look at me! What did you see?
2319,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"A tree, there was a white tree in a courtyard of stone. It was dead.    ,The city was burning."
2320,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?
2321,The Fellowship of the Ring,BOROMIR,They have a cave troll!
2322,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,Agh!  Let them come There's one dwarf yet in Moria who     still draws breath.
2323,The Fellowship of the Ring,ARAGORN,Pull!
2324,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Who are you ?
2325,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,Are you frightened?
2326,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Yes
2327,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you.
2328,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,Let him     go!  Or I'll have you Longshanks!
2329,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,You have a     stout heart little hobbit! But that will not save you.  You can no     longer wait for the wizard Frodo. They're coming
2330,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,What are they ?
2331,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,"They were once men. Great Kings of Men.  The Sauron     the Deciever  gave to them nine rings of power. Blinded by their greed     they took them without question. One by one falling into darkness    ,Now they are slaves to his will. They are     the Nazg'l. Ringwraiths.  Neither living nor dead. At all times they     feel the presence of the Ring , Drawn to the power of the One    , They     will never stop hunting you."
2332,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Where are you taking us ?
2333,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,Into the wild
2334,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf ?
2335,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,"I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer, but feel     fouler."
2336,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,He's foul enough
2337,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,We have no choice but to trust him
2338,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Yes, yes."
2339,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,He's very fond of you.
2340,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"I know, he'd probably come with me if I asked him to. I     think in his heart Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the woods, the     fields and the little rivers. I am old Gandalf. I know I don't look it, but     I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. , I feel     thin, sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a     holiday, a very long holiday. And I don't expect that I shall return. In     fact, I mean not to."
2341,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Old Toby, the finest weed in the Southfarthing."
2342,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Gandalf my old friend, this will be a night to     remember."
2343,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"I saw' I saw him! , I     could hear his voice in my head."
2344,The Return of the King,GANDALF,And what did you tell him? Speak!
2345,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,He asked me my name. I didn't answer. He hurt me!
2346,The Return of the King,GANDALF,What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?
2347,The Return of the King,GANDALF,There was no lie in Pippin's eyes. A fool but an honest fool he remains.
2348,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring. ,We've been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the Palantir a glimpse     of the enemy's plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith."
2349,The Return of the King,GAN DALF,"His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.    , He knows the Heir of     Elendil has come forth ,     Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still. Strength enough,     perhaps, to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples     of Middle Earth uniting under one banner. , He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground    , before he     sees a King return to the throne of men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit     Rohan must be ready for war."
2350,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Tell me! Why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to     ours? What do we owe Gondor?
2351,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,I will go!
2352,The Return of the King,GANDALF,No!
2353,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,They must be warned!
2354,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,But where     is he leading us ?
2355,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,To Rivendell Master Gamgee.  To the House of Elrond.
2356,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,D'you hear that!  Rivendell! We're going to see the     elves!
2357,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,Gentlemen! We do not stop 'til nightfall
2358,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,What about breakfast ?
2359,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,You've     already had it
2360,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,We've had one yes.  What about second breakfast ?
2361,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,Don't think he knows about second breakfast Pippin
2362,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,"What about elvenses ? Luncheon, Afternoon Tea, Dinner ?     Supper!  He knows about them, doesnt he ?"
2363,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,I wouldn't count on it
2364,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,Pippin!
2365,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"They will be. ,     You must come to Minas Tirith by another road. Follow the river. Look to the     black ships. ,     Understand this, things are now in motion that cannot be undone. I ride for     Minas Tirith , and I     wont be going alone."
2366,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Of all the Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst! Hurry! Hurry!"
2367,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Where are we going?
2368,The Return of the King,MERRY,Why did you look? Why do you always have to look?
2369,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"I don't know, I can't help it."
2370,The Return of the King,MERRY,You never can!
2371,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,I'm sorry alright? I won't do it again.
2372,The Return of the King,MERRY,Don't you understand? The enemy thinks you have the ring! He is going to     be looking for you Pip. They have to get you out of here.
2373,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"And you? You're coming with me? ,     Merry?"
2374,The Return of the King,MERRY,Come on!
2375,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,How far is Minas Tirith?
2376,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Three days ride as the Nazg'l flies. And you'd better hope we don't have     one of those on our tail.
2377,The Return of the King,MERRY,"Here, something for the road."
2378,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,The last of the Longbottom Leaf?
2379,The Return of the King,MERRY,I know you've run out. You smoke too much Pippin.
2380,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"But, we'll see each other soon?"
2381,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Wont we?
2382,The Return of the King,MERRY,I don't know! I don't know whats going to happen.
2383,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Merry?
2384,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Run, Shadowfax show us the meaning of haste."
2385,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Merry!
2386,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Merry!
2387,The Return of the King,MERRY,"He's always followed me everywhere I went since before we were tweens. I     would get him into the worst sort of trouble but I was always there to get     him out. Now he's gone. , Just     like Frodo and Sam."
2388,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,One thing I've learnt about Hobbits: They are a most hardy folk.
2389,The Return of the King,MERRY,Foolhardy maybe. He's a Took!
1,SW_EpisodeVI,SHUTTLE CAPTAIN,"Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield."
2,SW_EpisodeVI,DEATH STAR CONTROLLER,The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to proceed.
3,SW_EpisodeVI,SHUTTLE CAPTAIN,We're starting our approach.
4,SW_EpisodeVI,OFFICER,Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.
5,SW_EpisodeVI,OPERATOR,"Yes, sir."
6,SW_EpisodeVI,JERJERROD,"Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence."
7,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,"You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule."
8,SW_EpisodeVI,JERJERROD,"I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can."
9,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
10,SW_EpisodeVI,JERJERROD,"I tell you, this station will be operational as planned."
11,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
12,SW_EpisodeVI,JERJERROD,But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
13,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
14,SW_EpisodeVI,JERJERROD,The Emperor's coming here?
15,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,"That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress."
16,SW_EpisodeVI,JERJERROD,We shall double our efforts.
17,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,"I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am."
18,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place."
19,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, You'd probably short-circuit."
20,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose."
21,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke.
22,SW_EpisodeVI,STRANGE VOICE,Tee chuta hhat yudd!
23,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,Goodness gracious me!
24,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.
25,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go."
26,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this."
27,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me!"
28,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no."
29,SW_EpisodeVI,BIB,Die Wanna Wanga!
30,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt."
31,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"... and a gift. Gift, what gift?"
32,SW_EpisodeVI,BIB,Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.
33,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.
34,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things.
35,SW_EpisodeVI,BIB,Nudd Chaa.
36,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this."
37,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,Good morning.
38,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,Bo Shuda!
39,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"The message, Artoo, the message."
40,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids."
41,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,What did he say?
42,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.
43,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message."
44,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,There will be no bargain.
45,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,We're doomed.
46,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is.
47,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite."
48,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!
49,SW_EpisodeVI,NINEDENINE,"Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?"
50,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"I am See-Threepio, human-cy..."
51,SW_EpisodeVI,NINEDENINE,Yes or no will do.
52,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Oh. Well, yes."
53,SW_EpisodeVI,NINEDENINE,How many languages do you speak?
54,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily..."
55,SW_EpisodeVI,NINEDENINE,Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
56,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,Disintegrated?
57,SW_EpisodeVI,NINEDENINE,Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.
58,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!"
59,SW_EpisodeVI,NINEDENINE,"You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely."
60,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,Da Eitha!
61,SW_EpisodeVI,OOLA,Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...
62,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,Boscka!
63,SW_EpisodeVI,BOUSHH,I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.
64,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Oh, no! Chewbacca!"
65,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.
66,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!"
67,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty- five thousand.
68,SW_EpisodeVI,BOUSHH,I want fifty thousand. No less.
69,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand."
70,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,Because he's holding a thermal detonator.
71,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.
72,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.
73,SW_EpisodeVI,BOUSHH,Zeebuss.
74,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,He agrees!
75,SW_EpisodeVI,BOUSHH,Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite.
76,SW_EpisodeVI,BOUSHH,Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
77,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,I can't see.
78,SW_EpisodeVI,BOUSHH,You eyesight will return in time.
79,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Where am I?
80,SW_EpisodeVI,BOUSHH,Jabba's palace.
81,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Who are you?
82,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,Someone who loves you.
83,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Leia!
84,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,I gotta get you out of here.
85,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,What's that? I know that laugh.
86,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault."
87,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,"It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder."
88,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Look...
89,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,Take him away!
90,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!
91,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,Bring her to me.
92,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...
93,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,I'm sure.
94,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,Ugh!
95,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Ohhh, I can't bear to watch."
96,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Chewie? Chewie, is that you?"
97,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Ah! Chew--Chewie!
98,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?"
99,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less rescue anybody."
100,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets delusions of grandeur."
101,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"I'm all right, pal. I'm all right."
102,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,I must speak with Jabba.
103,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,You will take me to Jabba now!
104,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,You serve your master well.
105,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,And you will be rewarded.
106,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.
107,SW_EpisodeVI,BIB,Master.
108,SW_EpisodeVI,BIB,"...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight."
109,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,I told you not to admit him.
110,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,I must be allowed to speak.
111,SW_EpisodeVI,BIB,He must be allowed to speak.
112,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.
113,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.
114,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,"Your mind powers will not work on me, boy."
115,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers."
116,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Master Luke, you're standing on..."
117,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,"There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die."
118,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,Bascka!
119,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Oh, no! The Rancor!"
120,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.
121,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Han!
122,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Luke!
123,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Are you all right?
124,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Fine. Together again, huh?"
125,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Wouldn't miss it.
126,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,How are we doing?
127,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,The same as always.
128,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"That bad, huh? Where's Leia?"
129,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,I'm here.
130,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately."
131,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Good, I hate long waits."
132,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc."
133,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Doesn't sound so bad.
134,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years."
135,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?"
136,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make."
137,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur."
138,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know."
139,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient."
140,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
141,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Oh... great!
142,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,Soon you will learn to appreciate me.
143,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?"
144,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!"
145,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,Hmm. I wish I had your confidence.
146,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas."
147,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right?"
148,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.
149,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,Move him into position.
150,SW_EpisodeVI,JABBA,Put him in.
151,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Easy, Chewie."
152,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,Whoa! Whoa! Help!
153,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Chewie, you okay? Where is he?"
154,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"I'm okay, pal."
155,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,Han! Chewie?
156,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Lando!
157,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
158,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Lando, grab it!"
159,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,Lower it!
160,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,I'm trying!
161,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping."
162,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!
163,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!
164,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,Hold it! Whoa!
165,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie."
166,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando."
167,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,"No, wait! I thought you were blind!"
168,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
169,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
170,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!"
171,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.
172,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!"
173,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Get the gun! Point it at the deck!
174,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Point it at the deck!
175,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump."
176,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Come on!
177,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Let's go! And don't forget the droids.
178,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,We're on our way.
179,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
180,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,That's all any of us can see.
181,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Then I guess I'm getting better.
182,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there."
183,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.
184,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing!"
185,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,I'll see you back at the fleet.
186,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
187,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
188,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando."
189,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,"Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later."
190,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,He means \You're welcome.\
191,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,"Come on, let's get off this miserable dust ball."
192,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,I'll meet you back at the fleet.
193,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.
194,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,I will.
195,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one."
196,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend."
197,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"Rise, my friend."
198,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
199,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker."
200,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,"Yes, my Master."
201,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force."
202,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,As you wish.
203,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
204,SW_EpisodeVI,YODA,Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?
205,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,No... of course not.
206,SW_EpisodeVI,YODA,"I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become. Old and weak. When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?"
207,SW_EpisodeVI,YODA,"Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have."
208,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Master Yoda, you can't die."
209,SW_EpisodeVI,YODA,Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things ... the way of the Force.
210,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
211,SW_EpisodeVI,YODA,No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
212,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Then I am a Jedi?
213,SW_EpisodeVI,YODA,"Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will."
214,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?
215,SW_EpisodeVI,YODA,Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.
216,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Yoda, I must know."
217,SW_EpisodeVI,YODA,Your father he is.
218,SW_EpisodeVI,YODA,"Told you, did he?"
219,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Yes.
220,SW_EpisodeVI,YODA,"Unexpected this is, and unfortunate.."
221,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Unfortunate that I know the truth?
222,SW_EpisodeVI,YODA,No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you.
223,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Well, I'm sorry."
224,SW_EpisodeVI,YODA,"Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny."
225,SW_EpisodeVI,YODA,"Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I , the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... There is... another...Sky...Sky...walker."
226,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone."
227,SW_EpisodeVI,BEN,Yoda will always be with you.
228,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?
229,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
230,SW_EpisodeVI,BEN,"You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view."
231,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,A certain point of view!
232,SW_EpisodeVI,BEN,"Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view."
233,SW_EpisodeVI,BEN,"I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault."
234,SW_EpisodeVI,BEN,Anakin was a good friend.
235,SW_EpisodeVI,BEN,"When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy."
236,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,There's still good in him.
237,SW_EpisodeVI,BEN,I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
238,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"I can't do it, Ben."
239,SW_EpisodeVI,BEN,You cannot escape your destiny.
240,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
241,SW_EpisodeVI,BEN,"Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke...but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared."
242,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,But I had to help my friends.
243,SW_EpisodeVI,BEN,"And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear."
244,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,I found out Darth Vader was my father.
245,SW_EpisodeVI,BEN,"To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!"
246,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,I can't kill my own father.
247,SW_EpisodeVI,BEN,Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
248,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Yoda spoke of another.
249,SW_EpisodeVI,BEN,The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
250,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,But I have no sister.
251,SW_EpisodeVI,BEN,"Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous."
252,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Leia! Leia's my sister.
253,SW_EpisodeVI,BEN,"Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor."
254,SW_EpisodeVI,BEN,"When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible. So I took you to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan."
255,SW_EpisodeVI,BEN,"The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, since Alderaan had long been a democracy. Even so, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster father's path, became a senator as well. That's not all she became, of course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause. That's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate."
256,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her."
257,SW_EpisodeVI,BEN,"She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke ... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!"
258,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Well, look at you, a general, huh?"
259,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,"Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab."
260,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack."
261,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.
262,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Well, who says they didn't. But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?"
263,SW_EpisodeVI,MON MOTHMA,The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.
264,SW_EpisodeVI,MON MOTHMA,"The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star."
265,SW_EpisodeVI,MON MOTHMA,"Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please."
266,SW_EpisodeVI,ACKBAR,"You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor."
267,SW_EpisodeVI,ACKBAR,General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack
268,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Good luck.
269,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,You're gonna need it.
270,SW_EpisodeVI,ACKBAR,General Madine.
271,SW_EpisodeVI,GENERAL MADINE,"We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator."
272,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,Sounds dangerous.
273,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,I wonder who they found to pull that off.
274,SW_EpisodeVI,GENERAL MADINE,"General Solo, is your strike team assembled?"
275,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle."
276,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you."
277,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,That's one.
278,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,"Uh, General... count me in."
279,SW_EpisodeVI,VOICE,"I'm with you, too!"
280,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,What is it?
281,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Ask me again sometime.
282,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Luke.
283,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Hi, Han... Chewie."
284,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,\Exciting\ is hardly the word I would use.
285,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
286,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,"All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?"
287,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.
288,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,"Look, would you get going, you pirate."
289,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,Good luck.
290,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"You, too."
291,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,You got her warmed?
292,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Yeah, she's comin' up."
293,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her, Chewie."
294,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,"Hey, are you awake?"
295,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again."
296,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,"Come on, General, let's move."
297,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?"
298,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,All set.
299,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,Here we go again.
300,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"All right, hang on."
301,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,"What is thy bidding, my Master?"
302,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
303,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
304,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders."
305,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,"Yes, my Master."
306,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie."
307,SW_EpisodeVI,CONTROLLER,We have you on our screen now. Please identify.
308,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.
309,SW_EpisodeVI,CONTROLLER,"Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage."
310,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Transmission commencing.
311,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
312,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,It'll work. It'll work.
313,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Vader's on that ship.
314,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance."
315,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,I don't know. Fly casual.
316,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
317,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here."
318,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,Where is that shuttle going?
319,SW_EpisodeVI,PIETT,"Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?"
320,SW_EpisodeVI,PILOT VOICE,Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.
321,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,Do they have a code clearance?
322,SW_EpisodeVI,PIETT,"It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them."
323,SW_EpisodeVI,PIETT,Shall I hold them?
324,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.
325,SW_EpisodeVI,PIETT,"As you wish, my lord. Carry on."
326,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"They're not goin' for it, Chewie."
327,SW_EpisodeVI,CONTROLLER,"Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course."
328,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.
329,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Oh, I told you it was dangerous here."
330,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,Shall we try and go around?
331,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
332,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
333,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Quietly, there might be more of them out there."
334,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Hey... it's me.
335,SW_EpisodeVI,SCOUT #1,Go for help! Go!
336,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Great. Come on.
337,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,Over there! Two more of them!
338,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"I see them. Wait, Leia!"
339,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!
340,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Hey, wait! Ahhh!"
341,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Move closer!
342,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Get alongside that one!
343,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Get him!
344,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Keep on that one! I'll take these two!
345,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!"
346,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Luke! Where's Leia?
347,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,What? She didn't come back?
348,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,I thought she was with you.
349,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,We got separated.
350,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Hey, we better go look for her."
351,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
352,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Come on, Artoo. We'll need your scanners."
353,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do."
354,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!
355,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,Cut it out!
356,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,I'm not gonna hurt you.
357,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,"Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here is."
358,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,"Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down."
359,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.
360,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,All right. You want something to eat?
361,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,That's right. Come on. Hmmm?
362,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,"Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you?"
363,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,What is it?
364,SW_EpisodeVI,SCOUT #l,"Freeze! Come on, get up!"
365,SW_EpisodeVI,SCOUT #1,Go get your ride and take her back to base.
366,SW_EpisodeVI,SCOUT #2,"Yes, sir."
367,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,"Come on, let's get outta here."
368,SW_EpisodeVI,GUARD,Halt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment.
369,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,"The Emperor will see me, now!"
370,SW_EpisodeVI,GUARD,"The Emperor will see you, now."
371,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,I told you to remain on the command ship.
372,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
373,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"Yes, I know."
374,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,My son is with them.
375,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,Are you sure?
376,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,"I have felt him, my Master."
377,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader."
378,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,"They are clear, my Master."
379,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
380,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,He will come to me?
381,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you and then you will bring him before me.
382,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,As you wish.
383,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Luke! Luke!
384,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Oh, Master Luke."
385,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.
386,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.
387,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,I hope she's alright.
388,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"What, Chewie? What? Chewie!"
389,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Hey, I don't get it."
390,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie."
391,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Chewie, wa-wait! Don't!"
392,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach."
393,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber?"
394,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Yeah, sure."
395,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!!"
396,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Wha--? Hey! Point that thing someplace else.
397,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Hey!
398,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Han, don't. It'll be all right."
399,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Chewie, give 'em your crossbow."
400,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!"
401,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Do you understand anything they're saying?
402,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication."
403,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,What are you telling them?
404,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god."
405,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?"
406,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper."
407,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Proper?!
408,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
409,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Why, you--"
410,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.
411,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,I have a really bad feeling about this.
412,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,What did he say?
413,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor."
414,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN and LUKE,Leia!
415,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,Oh!
416,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,Your Royal Highness.
417,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,"But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free."
418,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much."
419,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic."
420,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"But Master Luke, what magic? couldn't possibly --"
421,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Just tell them.
422,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just..."
423,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh!"
424,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!"
425,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness."
426,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Thanks, Threepio."
427,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,I...I never knew I had it in me.
428,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that."
429,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,What's going on?
430,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,I don't know.
431,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.
432,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Just what I always wanted.
433,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. Thank you. Okay."
434,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.
435,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try and get our weapons back."
436,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day."
437,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Luke, what's wrong?"
438,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
439,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
440,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,What do you remember?
441,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,"Just...images, really. Feelings."
442,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Tell me.
443,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,"She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad. Why are you asking me all this?"
444,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
445,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,"Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?"
446,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Vader is here...now, on this moon."
447,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,How do you know?
448,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him."
449,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,Why?
450,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,He's my father.
451,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,Your father?
452,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance."
453,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,"Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have."
454,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it."
455,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Yes. It's you Leia.
456,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,I know. Somehow...I've always known.
457,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Then you know why I have to face him.
458,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,"No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you."
459,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"No, you don't. You've always been strong."
460,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,"But, why must you confront him?"
461,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
462,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Hey, what's goin' on?"
463,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.
464,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on?"
465,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,I...I can't tell you.
466,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?
467,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,I...
468,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Ahhh...
469,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,I'm sorry.
470,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,Hold me.
471,SW_EpisodeVI,COMMANDER,"This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area."
472,SW_EpisodeVI,COMMANDER,He was armed only with this.
473,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,"Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me."
474,SW_EpisodeVI,COMMANDER,"Yes, my Lord."
475,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,The Emperor has been expecting you.
476,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"I know, father."
477,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,"So, you have accepted the truth."
478,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father."
479,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,That name no longer has any meaning for me.
480,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.
481,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.
482,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,"Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen."
483,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Come with me.
484,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
485,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
486,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
487,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,If that is your destiny.
488,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate."
489,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,"It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now."
490,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Then my father is truly dead.
491,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
492,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this."
493,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,What's he saying?
494,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
495,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,"Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for."
496,SW_EpisodeVI,ACKBAR,Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
497,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,"Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time."
498,SW_EpisodeVI,ACKBAR,"All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark."
499,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,All right. Stand by.
500,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Back door, huh? Good idea."
501,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.
502,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,"Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm."
503,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Then we'll do it real quiet-like.
504,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!"
505,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,Quiet.
506,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
507,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,"Oh, no."
508,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,There goes our surprise attack.
509,SW_EpisodeVI,SCOUT,Look! Over there! Stop him!
510,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this.
511,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,I have decided that we shall stay here.
512,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you."
513,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,You no longer need those.
514,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"Guards, leave us."
515,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master.
516,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.
517,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things."
518,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,His lightsaber.
519,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you."
520,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.
521,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.
522,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.
523,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Your overconfidence is your weakness.
524,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,Your faith in your friends is yours.
525,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,"It is pointless to resist, my son."
526,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon...
527,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them.
528,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.
529,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie."
530,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
531,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Charges! Come on, come on!"
532,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Oh, my! They'll be captured!"
533,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me."
534,SW_EpisodeVI,COMMANDER,Freeze! You Rebel scum.
535,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,All wings report in.
536,SW_EpisodeVI,WEDGE,Red Leader standing by.
537,SW_EpisodeVI,GRAY LEADER,Gray Leader standing by.
538,SW_EpisodeVI,GREEN LEADER,Green Leader standing by.
539,SW_EpisodeVI,WEDGE,Lock S-foils in attack positions.
540,SW_EpisodeVI,ACKBAR,May the Force be with us.
541,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,"We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming."
542,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,Break off the attack! The shield is still up.
543,SW_EpisodeVI,RED LEADER,I get no reading. Are you sure?
544,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,Pull up! All craft pull up!
545,SW_EpisodeVI,ACKBAR,"Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7."
546,SW_EpisodeVI,CONTROLLER,"Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47."
547,SW_EpisodeVI,ACKBAR,It's a trap!
548,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,Fighters coming in.
549,SW_EpisodeVI,REBEL PILOT,There's too many of them!
550,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers.
551,SW_EpisodeVI,WEDGE,"Copy, Gold Leader."
552,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"Come, boy. See for yourself."
553,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and the end of your insignificant Rebellion."
554,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my servant."
555,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,No!
556,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!"
557,SW_EpisodeVI,STORMTROOPER,"All right, move it! I said move it! Go on!"
558,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?"
559,SW_EpisodeVI,BUNKER COMMANDER,Bring those two down here!
560,SW_EpisodeVI,STORMTROOPER,Let's go!
561,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?"
562,SW_EpisodeVI,STORMTROOPER,Freeze! Don't move!
563,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,We surrender.
564,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo."
565,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,The code's changed. We need Artoo!
566,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Here's the terminal.
567,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,"Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away."
568,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!"
569,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,"Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above!"
570,SW_EpisodeVI,WEDGE,"Red Three, Red Two, pull in!"
571,SW_EpisodeVI,RED TWO,Got it!
572,SW_EpisodeVI,RED THREE,"Three of them coming in, twenty degrees!"
573,SW_EpisodeVI,WEDGE,Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate.
574,SW_EpisodeVI,NAVIGATOR,Pressure's steady.
575,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,Only the fighters are attacking. I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for.
576,SW_EpisodeVI,COMMANDER,"We're in attack position now, sir."
577,SW_EpisodeVI,PIETT,Hold here.
578,SW_EpisodeVI,COMMANDER,We're not going to attack?
579,SW_EpisodeVI,PIETT,I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.
580,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander."
581,SW_EpisodeVI,JERJERROD,Fire!
582,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,"That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational! Home One, this is Gold Leader."
583,SW_EpisodeVI,ACKBAR,We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
584,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,"You won't get another chance at this, Admiral."
585,SW_EpisodeVI,ACKBAR,"We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude."
586,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
587,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,We're coming!
588,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Come on! Come on!
589,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Oh, Artoo, hurry!"
590,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?"
591,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing."
592,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,I'll cover you.
593,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point- blank range.
594,SW_EpisodeVI,ACKBAR,"At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers."
595,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
596,SW_EpisodeVI,REBEL PILOT,She's gonna blow!
597,SW_EpisodeVI,Y-WING PILOT,I'm hit!
598,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends."
599,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete."
600,SW_EpisodeVI,WALKER PILOT #1,Look!
601,SW_EpisodeVI,PILOT #2,Get him off of there!
602,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,I think I got it. I got it!
603,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?"
604,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Let's see.
605,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,It's not bad.
606,SW_EpisodeVI,STORMTROOPER,Freeze!
607,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,"Oh, dear."
608,SW_EpisodeVI,STORMTROOPER,Don't move!
609,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,I love you.
610,SW_EpisodeVI,LEIA,I know.
611,SW_EpisodeVI,STORMTROOPER,Hands up! Stand up!
612,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Stay back.
613,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,"Chewie! Get down here! She's wounded! No, wait.... I got an idea."
614,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"Good. Use your aggressive feelings, boy! Let the hate flow through you."
615,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,Obi-Wan has taught you well.
616,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"I will not fight you, father."
617,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,You are unwise to lower your defenses.
618,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict."
619,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,There is no conflict.
620,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now."
621,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,"You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny."
622,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,Good. Good.
623,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,Watch out. Squad at .06.
624,SW_EpisodeVI,REBEL PILOT,"I'm on it, Gold Leader."
625,SW_EpisodeVI,WEDGE,"Good shot, Red Two."
626,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,"Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down."
627,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN/PILOT,"It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit."
628,SW_EpisodeVI,CONTROL ROOM COMMANDER,Send three squads to help. Open the back door.
629,SW_EpisodeVI,SECOND COMMANDER,"Yes, sir."
630,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Throw me another charge.
631,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,"You cannot hide forever, Luke."
632,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,I will not fight you.
633,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,"Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for..."
634,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,"Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will."
635,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Never-r-r!
636,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side!"
637,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me."
638,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,So be it...Jedi.
639,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Move! Move!
640,SW_EpisodeVI,ACKBAR,The shield is down! Commence attack on the Death Star's main reactor.
641,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,"We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. Told you they'd do it!"
642,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed."
643,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand."
644,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision.
645,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,"Father, please. Help me."
646,SW_EpisodeVI,EMPEROR,"Now, young Skywalker...you will die."
647,SW_EpisodeVI,WEDGE,I'm going in.
648,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,Here goes nothing.
649,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
650,SW_EpisodeVI,WEDGE,Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
651,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you.
652,SW_EpisodeVI,PILOT,"Copy, Gold Leader."
653,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,That was too close.
654,SW_EpisodeVI,ACKBAR,We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer.
655,SW_EpisodeVI,CONTROLLER,"Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield."
656,SW_EpisodeVI,PIETT,Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through.
657,SW_EpisodeVI,PIETT,Intensify forward firepower!
658,SW_EpisodeVI,COMMANDER,It's too late!
659,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,"Luke, help me take this mask off."
660,SW_EpisodeVI,LURE,But you'll die.
661,SW_EpisodeVI,VADER,Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes.
662,SW_EpisodeVI,ANAKIN,"Now...go, my son. Leave me."
663,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you.
664,SW_EpisodeVI,ANAKIN,"You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right."
665,SW_EpisodeVI,LUKE,Father... I won't leave you.
666,SW_EpisodeVI,WEDGE,There it is!
667,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,"All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower."
668,SW_EpisodeVI,WEDGE,"Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out."
669,SW_EpisodeVI,ACKBAR,Move the fleet away from the Death Star.
670,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,"Wedge, I don't think we're going to make it."
671,SW_EpisodeVI,WEDGE,You'll make it. Just follow me Gold Leader.
672,SW_EpisodeVI,LANDO,I promised to return his ship without a scratch...I sure hope that old pirate forgives me.
673,SW_EpisodeVI,HAN,Lando...
674,SW_EpisodeVI,THREEPIO,They did it!
1,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you read me?"
2,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Loud and clear, kid. What's up?"
3,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings."
4,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back.
5,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long.
6,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?"
7,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Aaargh!
8,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Chewie!
9,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give you a hand."
10,SW_EpisodeV,RIEEKAN,Solo?
11,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place. You'll know if anything comes around."
12,SW_EpisodeV,RIEEKAN,Commander Skywalker reported in yet?
13,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.
14,SW_EpisodeV,RIEEKAN,"With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships."
15,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore."
16,SW_EpisodeV,RIEEKAN,I'm sorry to hear that.
17,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man."
18,SW_EpisodeV,RIEEKAN,"A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you."
19,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Thank you, General."
20,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it."
21,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,That's right.
22,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess."
23,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Han!
24,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Yes, Your Highnessness?"
25,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,I thought you decided to stay.
26,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind."
27,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"Han, we need you!"
28,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,We?
29,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Yes.
30,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Oh, what about you need?"
31,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,I need? I don't know what you're talking about.
32,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,You probably don't.
33,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,And what precisely am I supposed to know?
34,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
35,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader...
36,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh -- uh huh! Come on.
37,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,You're imagining things.
38,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?
39,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.
40,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!
41,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know.
42,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Oh, switch off."
43,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these.
44,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir."
45,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Put them back together right now.
46,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Might I have a word with you, please?"
47,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,What do you want?
48,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator."
49,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.
50,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is."
51,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,I don't know where he is.
52,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,Nobody knows where he is.
53,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"What do you mean, \nobody knows\?"
54,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Well, uh, you see..."
55,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Deck Officer. Deck Officer!
56,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-..."
57,SW_EpisodeV,DECK OFFICER,"Yes, sir?"
58,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?
59,SW_EpisodeV,DECK OFFICER,I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance.
60,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there.
61,SW_EpisodeV,DECK OFFICER,"Yes, sir."
62,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?"
63,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Why not?
64,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger."
65,SW_EpisodeV,DECK OFFICER,"Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in."
66,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Not likely. Are the speeders ready?
67,SW_EpisodeV,DECK OFFICER,Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold.
68,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
69,SW_EpisodeV,DECK OFFICER,"Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly."
70,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,That's right. And my friends out in it.
71,SW_EpisodeV,ASSISTANT OFFICER,I'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set screen alpha.
72,SW_EpisodeV,DECK OFFICER,Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first marker.
73,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Then I'll see you in hell!
74,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up."
75,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see. Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right."
76,SW_EpisodeV,LIEUTENANT,"Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from Skywalker or Solo."
77,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope."
78,SW_EpisodeV,DERLIN,"Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The shield doors must be closed."
79,SW_EpisodeV,DERLIN,Close the doors.
80,SW_EpisodeV,LIEUTENANT,"Yes, sir."
81,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five...to one.
82,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know...for a human being."
83,SW_EpisodeV,BEN,Luke...Luke.
84,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Ben?
85,SW_EpisodeV,BEN,You will go to the Dagobah system.
86,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Dagobah system?
87,SW_EpisodeV,BEN,"There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me."
88,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Ben...Ben.
89,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here."
90,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Not much time.
91,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Ben...Ben...
92,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Hang on, kid."
93,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Dagobah system...
94,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Whew...
95,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Dagobah...
96,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"This may smell bad, kid..."
97,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Yoda...
98,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,...but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built.  Ooh...I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
99,SW_EpisodeV,ZEV,"Echo Base...I've got something! Not much, but it could be a life form."
100,SW_EpisodeV,ZEV,"This is Rouge Two. this is Rouge Two. Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rouge Two."
101,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by.
102,SW_EpisodeV,ZEV,"Echo Base...this is Rouge Two. I found them. Repeat, I found them."
103,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional again."
104,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Artoo expresses his relief, also."
105,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark."
106,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Thanks to you.
107,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"That's two you owe me, junior."
108,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer."
109,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.
110,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
111,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain."
112,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage."
113,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,She expressed her true feelings for me.
114,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"My...! Why, you stuck up,...half-witted,...scruffy-looking... nerf-herder!"
115,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Who's scruffy-looking? I must have hit her pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?"
116,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet?"
117,SW_EpisodeV,ANNOUNCER,"Headquarters personnel, report to command center."
118,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Take it easy.
119,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Excuse us, please."
120,SW_EpisodeV,RIEEKAN,Princess...we have a visitor.
121,SW_EpisodeV,RIEEKAN,"We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east."
122,SW_EpisodeV,SENIOR CONTROLLER,It's metal.
123,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.
124,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"It could be a speeder, one of ours."
125,SW_EpisodeV,SENIOR CONTROLLER,No. Wait -- there's something very weak coming through.
126,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code."
127,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check it out."
128,SW_EpisodeV,RIEEKAN,Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.
129,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Afraid there's not much left.
130,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,What was it?
131,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct.
132,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,An Imperial probe droid.
133,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.
134,SW_EpisodeV,RIEEKAN,We'd better start the evacuation.
135,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,Admiral.
136,SW_EpisodeV,OZZEL,"Yes, Captain"
137,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,"I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment had."
138,SW_EpisodeV,OZZEL,"We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads!"
139,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,The visuals indicate life readings.
140,SW_EpisodeV,OZZEL,It could mean anything. If we followed every lead...
141,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,"But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms."
142,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,You found something?
143,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,"Yes, my lord."
144,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,That's it. The Rebels are there.
145,SW_EpisodeV,OZZEL,"My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers, it could be..."
146,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"That is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men."
147,SW_EpisodeV,REBEL CAPTAIN,"Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch."
148,SW_EpisodeV,REBEL FIGHTER,"Right, sir."
149,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Off!"
150,SW_EpisodeV,MEDICAL DROID,"Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty- sevens."
151,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports."
152,SW_EpisodeV,MEDICAL DROID,"Take care, sir."
153,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Thanks.
154,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?"
155,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Hi, kid. There's got to be a reason for it. Check it at the other end. Wait a second. You all right?"
156,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Yeah.
157,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Be careful.
158,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"You, too."
159,SW_EpisodeV,CONTROLLER,"General, there's a fleet of Star Destroyers coming out of hyperspace in sector four."
160,SW_EpisodeV,RIEEKAN,Reroute all power to the energy shield. We've got to hold them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault.
161,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"What is it, General?"
162,SW_EpisodeV,VEERS,"My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment."
163,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system.
164,SW_EpisodeV,VEERS,He felt surprise was wiser...
165,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack."
166,SW_EpisodeV,VEERS,"Yes, my lord."
167,SW_EpisodeV,OZZEL,"Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're preparing to...Aaagh!"
168,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett."
169,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,"Yes, my lord."
170,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett."
171,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,"Thank you, Lord Vader."
172,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports."
173,SW_EpisodeV,HOBBIE,Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?
174,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood?"
175,SW_EpisodeV,PILOTS,Right. Okay.
176,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Good luck.
177,SW_EpisodeV,DERLIN,Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let's go!
178,SW_EpisodeV,RIEEKAN,Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to open the shield.
179,SW_EpisodeV,CONTROLLER,"Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector."
180,SW_EpisodeV,CAPTAIN,Good. Our first catch of the day.
181,SW_EpisodeV,WOMAN CONTROLLER,"Stand by, ion control....Fire!"
182,SW_EpisodeV,ANNOUNCER,The first transport is away.
183,SW_EpisodeV,DACK,"Feeling all right, sir?"
184,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Just like new, Dack. How about you?"
185,SW_EpisodeV,DACK,Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself.
186,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,I know what you mean.
187,SW_EpisodeV,TRENCH OFFICER,Echo Station Three-T-Eight.
188,SW_EpisodeV,TRENCH OFFICER,We have spotted Imperial walkers!
189,SW_EpisodeV,CONTROLLER,Imperial walkers on the north ridge.
190,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.
191,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"All right, boys, keep tight now."
192,SW_EpisodeV,DACK,"Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set."
193,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now!"
194,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"All right, I'm coming in."
195,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Hobbie, you still with me?"
196,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,That armor's too strong for blasters.
197,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. All right, stand by, Dack."
198,SW_EpisodeV,DACK,"Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut in the auxiliary."
199,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Just hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable."
200,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Dack? Dack!
201,SW_EpisodeV,VEERS,"Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generator. The shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing."
202,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Rouge Three.
203,SW_EpisodeV,WEDGE,"Copy, Rouge Leader"
204,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass."
205,SW_EpisodeV,WEDGE,"Coming around, Rouge Leader."
206,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Steady, Rouge Two"
207,SW_EpisodeV,WEDGE,Activate harpoon.
208,SW_EpisodeV,WEDGE,"Good shot, Janson."
209,SW_EpisodeV,WEDGE,One more pass.
210,SW_EpisodeV,JANSON,Coming around. Once more.
211,SW_EpisodeV,JANSON,One more.
212,SW_EpisodeV,JANSON,Cable out! Let her go!
213,SW_EpisodeV,WEDGE,Detach cable.
214,SW_EpisodeV,JANSON,Cable detached.
215,SW_EpisodeV,TRENCH OFFICER,Come on!
216,SW_EpisodeV,WEDGE,Whooha!! That got him!
217,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"I see it, Wedge. Good work."
218,SW_EpisodeV,RIEEKAN,I don't think we can protect two transports at a time.
219,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice."
220,SW_EpisodeV,RIEEKAN,Launch patrols.
221,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Evacuate remaining ground staff.
222,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right?"
223,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear."
224,SW_EpisodeV,VEERS,All troops will debark for ground assault. Prepare to target the main generator.
225,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Rouge Two, are you all right?"
226,SW_EpisodeV,ZEV,"Yeah. I'm with you, Rouge Leader."
227,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,We'll set harpoon. I'll cover for you.
228,SW_EpisodeV,ZEV,Coming around.
229,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Watch that cross fire, boys."
230,SW_EpisodeV,ZEV,Set for position three. Steady.
231,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Stay tight and low.
232,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Hobbie, I've been hit!"
233,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,You all right?
234,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Why are you still here?
235,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,I heard the command center had been hit.
236,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,You got your clearance to leave.
237,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship.
238,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope."
239,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters.
240,SW_EpisodeV,ANNOUNCER,Imperial troops have entered the base.
241,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Come on...that's it.
242,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports!
243,SW_EpisodeV,HEAD CONTROLLER,K-one-zero...all troops disengage.
244,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,Oh! Wait for me!
245,SW_EpisodeV,OFFICER,Begin retreat!
246,SW_EpisodeV,SECOND OFFICER,Fall back!
247,SW_EpisodeV,VEERS,Distance to power generators?
248,SW_EpisodeV,PILOT,"One-seven, decimal two-eight."
249,SW_EpisodeV,VEERS,Target. Maximum fire power.
250,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Transport, this is Solo. Better take off -- I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon."
251,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!!
252,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop!
253,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,How typical.
254,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Come on.
255,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident!"
256,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,Wait! Wait!
257,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,How's this?
258,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Would it helped if I got out and pushed?
259,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,It might.
260,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that you..."
261,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,It can wait.
262,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,The bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
263,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart."
264,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a burnout.
265,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,See?
266,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it."
267,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Punch it!
268,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff.
269,SW_EpisodeV,WEDGE,"Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous."
270,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going."
271,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course."
272,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,We're not going to regroup with the others.
273,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,We're going to the Dagobah system.
274,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Yes, Artoo?"
275,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,That's all right. I'd like to keep it on manual control for a while.
276,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,I saw them! I saw them!
277,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Saw what?
278,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us."
279,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Sir, sir! Might I suggest..."
280,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Shut him up or shut him down! Check the deflector shield!
281,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them."
282,SW_EpisodeV,IMPERIAL OFFICER,Take evasive action!
283,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Prepare to make the jump to light-speed.
284,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"But, sir!"
285,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,They're getting closer!
286,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Oh yeah? Watch this.
287,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Watch what?
288,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,I think we're in trouble.
289,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed!"
290,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,We're in trouble!
291,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Horizontal boosters...!
292,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it.
293,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Bring me the hydrospanners!
294,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,I don't know how we're going to get out of this one.
295,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Oww! Chewie!
296,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,That was no laser blast! Something hit us.
297,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"Han, get up here!"
298,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Come on, Chewie!"
299,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Asteroids!
300,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one."
301,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field?
302,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?"
303,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,You don't have to do this to impress me.
304,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one."
305,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Never tell me the odds!
306,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well, this could be it, sweetheart."
307,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
308,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,I'm not going to argue with that.
309,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,Pulverized?
310,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,I'm going in closer to one of the big ones.
311,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Closer?
312,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,Closer?!
313,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Oh, this is suicide!"
314,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,There. That looks pretty good.
315,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,What looks pretty good?
316,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Yeah. That'll do nicely.
317,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?"
318,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,I hope you know what you're doing.
319,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Yeah, me too."
320,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Yes, that's it. Dagobah."
321,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"No, I'm not going to change my mind about this.  I'm not picking up any cities or technology. Massive life-form readings, though. There's something alive down there..."
322,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids."
323,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle..."
324,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around."
325,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Artoo?
326,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Artoo! Where are you?
327,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Artoo! You be more careful.
328,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Artoo -- that way!
329,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Artoo!
330,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste very good. Anything broken?"
331,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy."
332,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"Yes, Admiral?"
333,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,"Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But...it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk..."
334,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want that ship and not excuses."
335,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,"Yes, lord."
336,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.
337,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include shutting me down, too?"
338,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive."
339,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable."
340,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive."
341,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most..."
342,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Let go.
343,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Sshh!
344,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"Let go, please."
345,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Don't get excited.
346,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited."
347,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else."
348,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go.
349,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even exists.
350,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel like...I don't know...
351,SW_EpisodeV,STRANGE VOICE,Feel like what?
352,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Like we're being watched!
353,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm.
354,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,"I am wondering, why are you here?"
355,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,I'm looking for someone.
356,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,"Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?"
357,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Right.
358,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,"Help you I can. Yes, mmmm."
359,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.
360,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,Ahhh! A great warrior. Wars not make one great.
361,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner.
362,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,"How you get so big, eating food of this kind?"
363,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just..."
364,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,"Aww, cannot get your ship out?"
365,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that!"
366,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,Mine! Or I will help you not.
367,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.
368,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.
369,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,"Ah, ah, ah!"
370,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Oh, Artoo, let him have it."
371,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,Mine! Mine!
372,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Artoo!
373,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,Mine!
374,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,Mine!
375,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot of work to do."
376,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,"No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will. Find your friend, hmm?"
377,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master."
378,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda.
379,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,You know him?
380,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,"Mmm. Take you to him, I will. Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come."
381,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,"Come, come."
382,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo."
383,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Oh, where is Artoo when I need him?"
384,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it."
385,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Well, of course I'll have to replace it."
386,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Here! And Chewie...
387,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,...I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling.
388,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help."
389,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Would you please stop calling me that?
390,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Sure, Leia."
391,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes."
392,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right."
393,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Occasionally maybe...when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
394,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.
395,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Stop that.
396,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Stop what?
397,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Stop that! My hands are dirty.
398,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?"
399,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Afraid?
400,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,You're trembling.
401,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,I'm not trembling.
402,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.
403,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,I happen to like nice men.
404,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,I'm a nice man.
405,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"No, you're not. You're..."
406,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling."
407,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Thank you. Thank you very much.
408,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir."
409,SW_EpisodeV,NEEDA,"...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed."
410,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found."
411,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,Lord Vader.
412,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"Yes, Admiral, what is it?"
413,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,The Emperor commands you make contact with him.
414,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission.
415,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,"Yes, my lord."
416,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"What is thy bidding, my master?"
417,SW_EpisodeV,EMPEROR,There is a great disturbance in the Force.
418,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,I have felt it.
419,SW_EpisodeV,EMPEROR,We have a new enemy -- Luke Skywalker.
420,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"Yes, my master."
421,SW_EpisodeV,EMPEROR,He could destroy us.
422,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.
423,SW_EpisodeV,EMPEROR,The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.
424,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally."
425,SW_EpisodeV,EMPEROR,Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done?
426,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"He will join us or die, my master."
427,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now."
428,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,"Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?"
429,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?
430,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,"Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him.  Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm?"
431,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Mostly because of my father, I guess."
432,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,"Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm."
433,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am. Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time."
434,SW_EpisodeV,CREATURE,I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.
435,SW_EpisodeV,BEN,He will learn patience.
436,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,"Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father."
437,SW_EpisodeV,BEN,Was I any different when you taught me?
438,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,Hah. He is not ready.
439,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready."
440,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,"Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!"
441,SW_EpisodeV,BEN,"So was I, if you'll remember."
442,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,"He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training."
443,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,But I've learned so much.
444,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,Will he finished what he begins?
445,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,I won't fail you -- I'm not afraid.
446,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,"Oh, you will be. You will be."
447,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Sir, if I may venture an opinion..."
448,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio."
449,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,There's something out there.
450,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Where?
451,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"Outside, in the cave."
452,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,There it is. Listen! Listen!
453,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,I'm going out there.
454,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Are you crazy?!
455,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let something tear it apart.
456,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Then I'm going with you.
457,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. Oh, no."
458,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at all.
459,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,There's an awful lot of moisture in here.
460,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.
461,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Yeah.
462,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Watch out!
463,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables."
464,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Mynocks?
465,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.
466,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo!
467,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Wait a minute...
468,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!"
469,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to...
470,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,No time to discuss this as a committee.
471,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,I am not a committee!
472,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field...
473,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off!"
474,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,Look!
475,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"I see it, I see it."
476,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,We're doomed!
477,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,The cave is collapsing.
478,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,This is no cave.
479,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,What?
480,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,"Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice."
481,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Vader. Is the dark side stronger?
482,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,"No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive."
483,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,But how am I to know the good side from the bad?
484,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,"You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack."
485,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,But tell me why I can't...
486,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,"No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm."
487,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,There's something not right here.
488,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"I feel cold, death."
489,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.
490,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,What's in there?
491,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,Only what you take with you.
492,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,Your weapons...you will not need them.
493,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum.
494,SW_EpisodeV,FIRST CONTROLLER,"Yes, sir."
495,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,Those Rebels won't escape us.
496,SW_EpisodeV,SECOND CONTROLLER,"Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger."
497,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,Right.
498,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations."
499,SW_EpisodeV,BOBA FETT,As you wish.
500,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,"Lord Vader! My lord, we have them."
501,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field."
502,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three!
503,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,It's not fair!
504,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!
505,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,No light-speed?
506,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,It's not my fault.
507,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for."
508,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Turn her around.
509,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front shield.
510,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,You're going to attack them?!
511,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer..."
512,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Shut up!
513,SW_EpisodeV,NEEDA,They're moving to attack position. Shields up!
514,SW_EpisodeV,NEEDA,"Track them,. They may come around for another pass."
515,SW_EpisodeV,TRACKING OFFICER,"Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes."
516,SW_EpisodeV,NEEDA,They can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device.
517,SW_EpisodeV,TRACKING OFFICER,"Well, there's no trace of them, sir."
518,SW_EpisodeV,COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER,"Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit."
519,SW_EpisodeV,NEEDA,"Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile, continue to scan the area."
520,SW_EpisodeV,COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER,"Yes, Captain Needa."
521,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,Use the Force. Yes...
522,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,Now...the stone. Feel it.
523,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,Concentrate!
524,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Oh, no. We'll never get it out now."
525,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?
526,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different."
527,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned.
528,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"All right, I'll give it a try."
529,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.
530,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,I can't. It's too big.
531,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,"Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm."
532,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,"And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we......not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!"
533,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,You want the impossible.
534,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,I don't...I don't believe it.
535,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,That is why you fail.
536,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"Apology accepted, Captain Needa."
537,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,"Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now."
538,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along their last know trajectory.
539,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,"Yes, my lord. We'll find them."
540,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"Don't fail me again, Admiral."
541,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.
542,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?"
543,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.
544,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...
545,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Thank you.
546,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,What did you have in mind for your next move?
547,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away."
548,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,With the rest of the garbage. Then what?
549,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas?
550,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,No. Where are we?
551,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,The Anoat system.
552,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Anoat system. There's not much there.
553,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando."
554,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Lando system?
555,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him."
556,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Thanks.
557,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it."
558,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,A mining colony?
559,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me."
560,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Can you trust him?
561,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that."
562,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!"
563,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them."
564,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,"Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone."
565,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Han! Leia!
566,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,"Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control."
567,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,I saw...I saw a city in the clouds.
568,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,Mmm. Friends you have there.
569,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,They were in pain.
570,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,It is the future you see.
571,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Future? Will they die?
572,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.
573,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,I've got to go to them.
574,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,"Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered."
575,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian."
576,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain.
577,SW_EpisodeV,INTERCOM VOICE,You will not deviate from your present course.
578,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Rather touchy, aren't they?"
579,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,I thought you knew this person.
580,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten about that."
581,SW_EpisodeV,INTERCOM VOICE,Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven.
582,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Thank you.
583,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me."
584,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Who's worried?
585,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,Oh. No one to meet us.
586,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,I don't like this.
587,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Well, what would you like?"
588,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Well, they did let us land."
589,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me."
590,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"See? My friend. Keep your eyes open, okay?"
591,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled."
592,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! I never thought I'd catch up with you again. Where you been?"
593,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Well, he seems very friendly."
594,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Yes...very friendly.
595,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,What are you doing here?
596,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Ahh...repairs. I thought you could help me out.
597,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,What have you done to my ship?
598,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square."
599,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. and who might you be?
600,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Leia.
601,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"Welcome, Leia."
602,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"All right, all right, you old smoothie."
603,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your..."
604,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Well, really!"
605,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,What's wrong with the Falcon?
606,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Hyperdrive.
607,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,I'll get my people to work on it.
608,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Good.
609,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy."
610,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you?
611,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny?"
612,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"You. Listen to you -- you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh?"
613,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things."
614,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Yeah.
615,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful."
616,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.
617,SW_EpisodeV,SECOND THREEPIO,E chu ta!
618,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,How rude!
619,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if...
620,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Hello? How interesting. Oh, my."
621,SW_EpisodeV,MAN,Who are you?
622,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!"
623,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,Luke! You must complete the training.
624,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've got to help them.
625,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,You must not go!
626,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,But Han and Leia will die if I don't.
627,SW_EpisodeV,BEN,You don't know that.
628,SW_EpisodeV,BEN,Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
629,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,But I can help them! I feel the Force!
630,SW_EpisodeV,BEN,"But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force."
631,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,"Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure at the cave!"
632,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word."
633,SW_EpisodeV,BEN,It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer.
634,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,And that is why I have to go.
635,SW_EpisodeV,BEN,"Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader."
636,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,You won't.
637,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,"Stopped they must be. On this depends. Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil."
638,SW_EpisodeV,BEN,Patience.
639,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,And sacrifice Han and Leia?
640,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,If you honor what they fight for...yes!
641,SW_EpisodeV,BEN,"If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot interfere."
642,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"I understand. Artoo, fire up the converters."
643,SW_EpisodeV,BEN,"Luke, don't give in to hate -- that leads to the dark side."
644,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.
645,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,I will. And I'll return. I promise.
646,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,"Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse."
647,SW_EpisodeV,BEN,That boy is our last hope.
648,SW_EpisodeV,YODA,No. There is another.
649,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're in great shape.
650,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.
651,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.
652,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,I don't trust Lando.
653,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides, we'll soon be gone."
654,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?"
655,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,What happened?
656,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Where? Found him in a junk pile?
657,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him?"
658,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Lando's got people who can fix him.
659,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"No, thanks."
660,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?
661,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Not really.
662,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds.
663,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Thank you.
664,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,Will you join me for a little refreshment?
665,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"Everyone's invited, of course."
666,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,Having trouble with you droid?
667,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,No. No problem. Why?
668,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire."
669,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,So you're part of the mining guild then?
670,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves."
671,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down?
672,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever.
673,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,We would be honored if you would join us.
674,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry.
675,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"I'm sorry, too."
676,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"No, Threepio's with them."
677,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Just hang on. We're almost there.
678,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh -- Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No!"
679,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!"
680,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,Lord Vader.
681,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker.
682,SW_EpisodeV,BOBA FETT,He's no good to me dead.
683,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,He will not be permanently damaged.
684,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?"
685,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,They must never again leave this city.
686,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!"
687,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
688,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,No.
689,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here.
690,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,This deal's getting worse all the time.
691,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough..."
692,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,I feel terrible.
693,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Why are they doing this?
694,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,They never even asked me any questions.
695,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Lando.
696,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Get out of here, Lando!"
697,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.
698,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Over to you?
699,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe."
700,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,What about Han?
701,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.
702,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Vader wants us all dead.
703,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called Skywalker.
704,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Luke?
705,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,Lord Vader has set a trap for him.
706,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,And we're the bait.
707,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"Well, he's on his way."
708,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you?  My friend!"
709,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems."
710,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Yeah, you're a real hero."
711,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,You certainly have a way with people.
712,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor."
713,SW_EpisodeV,IMPERIAL SOLDIER,"Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class."
714,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.
715,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it might kill him."
716,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on Captain Solo.
717,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish."
718,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,What's going on...buddy?
719,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,You're being put into carbon freeze.
720,SW_EpisodeV,BOBA FETT,What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me.
721,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!
722,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!"
723,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!"
724,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die."
725,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,"Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey!"
726,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess -- you have to take care of her. You hear me?
727,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,I love you!
728,SW_EpisodeV,HAN,I know.
729,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected -- if he survives the freezing process, that is."
730,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"Well, Calrissian, did he survive?"
731,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation."
732,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
733,SW_EpisodeV,IMPERIAL OFFICER,"Skywalker has just landed, my lord."
734,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship."
735,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.
736,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.
737,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"Luke! Luke, don't -- it's a trap! It's a trap!"
738,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi yet."
739,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,Well done. Hold them in the security tower -- and keep it quiet. Move.
740,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,What do you think you're doing?
741,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,We're getting out of here.
742,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,I knew all along it had to be a mistake.
743,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you?
744,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,I had no choice...
745,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!"
746,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice."
747,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,I'm just trying to help...
748,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,We don't need any of your help.
749,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,H-a-a-a...
750,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,What?
751,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,It sounds like Han.
752,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East Platform..."
753,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Chewie.
754,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee."
755,SW_EpisodeV,BOBA FETT,Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.
756,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been?
757,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Turn around, you wooly...! Hurry, hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!"
758,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened to me!"
759,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!"
760,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"You have learned much, young one."
761,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,You'll find I'm full of surprises.
762,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true."
763,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,No!
764,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought.
765,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,Impressive...most impressive.
766,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear... now release your anger.
767,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,Only your hatred can destroy me.
768,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,The security codes has been changed!
769,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system."
770,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive.
771,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,This way.
772,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal.
773,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"What are you talking about? We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump."
774,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!
775,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow!"
776,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,Leia! Go!
777,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course, I've looked better."
778,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.
779,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy."
780,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,I'll never join you!
781,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.
782,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,He told me enough! He told me you killed him.
783,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,No. I am your father.
784,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!
785,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,Search your feelings. You know it to be true.
786,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,No! No! No!
787,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way."
788,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Ben...Ben, please!"
789,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Ben. Leia!
790,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Hear me! Leia!
791,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Luke...We've got to go back.
792,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,What?
793,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,I know where Luke is.
794,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,But what about those fighter?
795,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"Chewie, just do it."
796,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,But what about Vader?
797,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"All right, all right, all right."
798,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,Bring my shuttle.
799,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"Look, someone's up there."
800,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him. Lando, open the top hatch."
801,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,"Okay. Easy, Chewie."
802,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Lando?
803,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"Okay, let's go."
804,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Oh, Leia."
805,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"All right, Chewie. Let's go."
806,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,I'll be back.
807,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,Star Destroyer.
808,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed."
809,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,If your people fixed the hyperdrive.
810,SW_EpisodeV,LEIA,All the coordinates are set. It's now or never.
811,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,Punch it!
812,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault!
813,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,"They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord."
814,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon?
815,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,"Yes, my lord."
816,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun.
817,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,"Yes, my lord."
818,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed?
819,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated?
820,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!"
821,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,Luke.
822,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Father.
823,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,"Son, come with me."
824,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Ben, why didn't you tell me?"
825,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,Chewie!
826,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,It's Vader.
827,SW_EpisodeV,VADER,Luke...it is your destiny.
828,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Ben, why didn't you tell me?"
829,SW_EpisodeV,PIETT,Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam.
830,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur!"
831,SW_EpisodeV,THREEPIO,"Oh, you did it!"
832,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"Luke, we're ready for takeoff."
833,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Good luck, Lando"
834,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you."
835,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine.
836,SW_EpisodeV,LANDO,"Princess, we'll find Han. I promise."
837,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal."
838,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,"Take care, you two. May the Force be with you."
839,SW_EpisodeV,LUKE,Ow!
1,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness!
2,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,We're doomed!
3,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.
4,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,What's that?
5,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...
6,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Hurry up! Come with me! What are you waiting for?! Get in gear!
7,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?"
8,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,At last! Where have you been?
9,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!
10,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Wait a minute, where are you going?"
11,SW_EpisodeIV,IMPERIAL OFFICER,The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
12,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
13,SW_EpisodeIV,REBEL OFFICER,We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah... This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.
14,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,If this is a consular ship... where is the Ambassador?
15,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,"Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive!"
16,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER,There she is! Set for stun!
17,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER,She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
18,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.."
19,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you."
20,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there!
21,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,I'm going to regret this.
22,SW_EpisodeIV,CHIEF PILOT,There goes another one.
23,SW_EpisodeIV,CAPTAIN,Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited.
24,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here."
25,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Are you sure this things safe?
26,SW_EpisodeIV,WOMAN,I've told you kids to slow down!
27,SW_EpisodeIV,FIXER,Did I hear a young noise blast through here?
28,SW_EpisodeIV,CAMIE,It was just Wormie on another rampage.
29,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?
30,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I didn't know you were back! When did you get in?
31,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,"Just now. I wanted to surprise you, hot shot. I thought you'd be here... certainly didn't expect you to be out working. "
32,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"The Academy didn't change you much... but you're back so soon? Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?"
33,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,Of course I got it. Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week. First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service...... I just came back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.
34,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I almost forgot. There's a battle going on! Right here in our system. Come and look!
35,SW_EpisodeIV,DEAK,Not again! Forget it.
36,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,There they are!
37,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,"That's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there! Probably a freighter-tanker refueling."
38,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,But there was a lot of firing earlier...
39,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Hey, easy with those..."
40,SW_EpisodeIV,CAMIE,"Don't worry about it, Wormie."
41,SW_EpisodeIV,FIXER,"I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here. I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system. Believe me Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing..."
42,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,"Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit stillfor this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic..."
43,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,"Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you."
44,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...
45,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor. Take her away!
46,SW_EpisodeIV,COMMANDER,"Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate."
47,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to find their secret base!
48,SW_EpisodeIV,COMMANDER,you anything.
49,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!
50,SW_EpisodeIV,SECOND OFFICER,"Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard."
51,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,"She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time."
52,SW_EpisodeIV,COMMANDER,"Yes, sir."
53,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life.
54,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. 
55,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,What a desolate place this is.
56,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Where are you going?
57,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier."
58,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,What makes you think there are settlements over there?
59,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Don't get technical with me.
60,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!"
61,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it."
62,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,No more adventures. I'm not going that way.
63,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better."
64,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved!"
65,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Over here! Help! Please, help!"
66,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"... so I cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail. I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty upset. He grounded me for the rest of the season. You should have been there... it was fantastic."
67,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,"You ought to take it a little easy Luke. You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall."
68,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Look who's talking. Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft in the city...
69,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,I've missed you kid.
70,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs. It's been so...quiet."
71,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,"Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye... I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know."
72,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,What are you talking about?
73,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,"I made some friends at the Academy. ... when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance..."
74,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! How?
75,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!
76,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I'm sorry. I'm quiet. Listen how quiet I am. You can barely hear me...
77,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.
78,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,around forever trying to find them.
79,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,"I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own... It's what we always talked about. Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service. The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side - the side I believe in. "
80,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,And I'm stuck here...
81,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,I thought you were going to the Academy next term. You'll get your chance to get off this rock.
82,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Not likely! I had to cancel my application. There has been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead.
83,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.
84,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off. He needs me for just one more season. I can't leave him now."
85,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,"I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important. What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?... You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems...it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire."
86,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,It couldn't happen here. You said it yourself. The Empire won't bother with this rock.
87,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,Things always change.
88,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I wish I was going... Are you going to be around long? 
89,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,"No, I'm leaving in the morning..."
90,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Then I guess I won't see you.
91,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.
92,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows. I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure... Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got."
93,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,"So long, Luke."
94,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!
95,SW_EpisodeIV,FIRST TROOPER,Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction. 
96,SW_EpisodeIV,SECOND TROOPER,"Look, sir - droids."
97,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Wake up! Wake up!
98,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,We're doomed.
99,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Do you think they'll melt us down?
100,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end?
101,SW_EpisodeIV,BERU,"Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce."
102,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him.
103,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,I have no need for a protocol droid.
104,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...
105,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,What I really need is a droid that understands the binary languages of moisture vaporators.
106,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Vaporators! Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators. You could say...
107,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,Do you speak Bocce?
108,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me... I'm as fluent in Bocce..."
109,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,All right; shut up! I'll take this one.
110,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Shutting up, sir."
111,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,"Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner."
112,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...
113,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,"You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now, come on, get to it!"
114,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red, let's go."
115,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Uncle Owen...
116,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,Yeah?
117,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!
118,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,"Hey, what're you trying to push on us?"
119,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain."
120,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Uncle Owen...
121,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,Yeah?
122,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,What about that one?
123,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,What about that blue one? We'll take that one.
124,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Yeah, take it away."
125,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes."
126,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Okay, let's go."
127,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Now, don't forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!"
128,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!"
129,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here!"
130,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Is there anything I might do to help? 
131,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!"
132,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on."
133,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from."
134,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"I see, sir."
135,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Uh, you can call me Luke."
136,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"I see, sir Luke."
137,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Just Luke.
138,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo."
139,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Hello.
140,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
141,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all."
142,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
143,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir."
144,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Have you been in many battles?
145,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways."
146,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a starcruiser or..."
147,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You'remy only hope."
148,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,What's this?
149,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,What is what?!? He asked you a question...What is that?
150,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope."
151,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind."
152,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Who is she? She's beautiful.
153,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir."
154,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi..."
155,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir - I believe. Our captain was attached to..."
156,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Is there more to this recording?
157,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master."
158,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric."
159,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
160,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?"
161,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit."
162,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing.
163,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording."
164,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay."
165,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,There you go.
166,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message."
167,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,been playing. The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! 
168,SW_EpisodeIV,AUNT BERU,Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!
169,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru."
170,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter."
171,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back."
172,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
173,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"No, I don't think he likes you at all."
174,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"No, I don't like you either."
175,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen."
176,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,What makes you think that?
177,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi."
178,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"I thought he might have meant Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben."
179,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,That old man's just a crazy wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now.
180,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
181,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,"He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father."
182,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,He knew my father?
183,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.
184,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year."
185,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,You mean the next semester before harvest?
186,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Sure, there're more than enough droids."
187,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year.
188,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,"You must understand I need you here, Luke."
189,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,But it's a whole 'nother year.
190,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,"Look, it's only one more season."
191,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left."
192,SW_EpisodeIV,AUNT BERU,Where are you going?
193,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.
194,SW_EpisodeIV,AUNT BERU,"Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him."
195,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,I'll make it up to him next year. I promise.
196,SW_EpisodeIV,AUNT BERU,"Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him."
197,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,That's what I'm afraid of.
198,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,What are you doing hiding there?
199,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission."
200,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Oh, no!"
201,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. 
202,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it!
203,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?"
204,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around. We'll have to wait until morning.
205,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,"Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night."
206,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it."
207,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.
208,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Oh, he excels at that, sir."
209,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be loafing now!
210,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,Have you seen Luke this morning?
211,SW_EpisodeIV,AUNT BERU,"He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early."
212,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him?
213,SW_EpisodeIV,AUNT BERU,I think so.
214,SW_EpisodeIV,OWEN,"Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or there'll be hell to pay!"
215,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,How's that.
216,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far. We must have missed him. Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well."
217,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault."
218,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Sure. He needs you. He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...
219,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Deactivate! Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt..."
220,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator."
221,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?"
222,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here."
223,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Well, come on. It's getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up."
224,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop."
225,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"No, he's not going to try anything."
226,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,What's wrong with him now?
227,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast."
228,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Sand People! Or worse! Come on, let's have a look. Come on."
229,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sand People all right. I can see one of them now."
230,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid.
231,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Don't worry, he'll be all right."
232,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,What happened?
233,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece."
234,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! "
235,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?"
236,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master... I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems tobe no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?"
237,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.
238,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead.
239,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet."
240,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,You know him!
241,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born."
242,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Then the droid does belong to you.
243,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... 
244,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,I think we better get indoors. The Sand People are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.
245,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,... Threepio!
246,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Where am I? I must have taken a bad step...
247,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sand People return.
248,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for."
249,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?"
250,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Quickly, son... they're on the move."
251,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter."
252,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
253,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,You fought in the Clone Wars?
254,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father."
255,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I wish I'd known him.
256,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me..."
257,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. "
258,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile."
259,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Sure, go ahead."
260,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,What is it?
261,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.
262,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire."
263,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,How did my father die?
264,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force."
265,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,The Force?
266,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together."
267,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from."
268,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I saw part of the message he was...
269,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,I seem to have found it.
270,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,"General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope."
271,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
272,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is."
273,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"I need your help, Luke. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.She needs your help."
274,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.
275,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,That's your uncle talking.
276,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?"
277,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Learn about the Force, Luke."
278,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going."
279,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"You must do what you feel is right, of course."
280,SW_EpisodeIV,TAGGE,Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize.
281,SW_EpisodeIV,MOTTI,"Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station!"
282,SW_EpisodeIV,TAGGE,The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate as long as....
283,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.
284,SW_EpisodeIV,TAGGE,That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?
285,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.
286,SW_EpisodeIV,TAGGE,"And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it."
287,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
288,SW_EpisodeIV,MOTTI,"Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!"
289,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
290,SW_EpisodeIV,MOTTI,"Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort..."
291,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,I find your lack of faith disturbing.
292,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,"Enough of this! Vader, release him!"
293,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,As you wish.
294,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.
295,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"It looks like Sand People did this, all right. Look, here are gaffi sticks, bantha tracks. It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before."
296,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.
297,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.
298,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise."
299,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?
300,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them back home!"
301,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous."
302,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!
303,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,"And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base."
304,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire."
305,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.
306,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.
307,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER,How long have you had these droids?
308,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,About three or four seasons.
309,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,They're for sale if you want them.
310,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER,Let me see your identification.
311,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,You don't need to see his identification.
312,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER,We don't need to see his identification.
313,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,looking for.
314,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER,These are not the droids we're looking for.
315,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,He can go about his business.
316,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER,You can go about your business.
317,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,Move along.
318,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER,Move along. Move along.
319,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures.
320,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I thought we were dead."
321,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally.
322,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?
323,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only watch your step. This place can be a little rough."
324,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I'm ready for anything.
325,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Come along, Artoo."
326,SW_EpisodeIV,BARTENDER,We don't serve their kind here!
327,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,What?
328,SW_EpisodeIV,BARTENDER,Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here.
329,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any trouble."
330,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,I heartily agree with you sir.
331,SW_EpisodeIV,CREATURE,Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?
332,SW_EpisodeIV,HUMAN,He doesn't like you.
333,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I'm sorry.
334,SW_EpisodeIV,HUMAN,I don't like you either
335,SW_EpisodeIV,HUMAN,Don't insult us. You just watch yourself. We're wanted men. I have the death sentence on twelve systems.
336,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I'll be careful than.
337,SW_EpisodeIV,HUMAN,You'll be dead.
338,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you something...
339,SW_EpisodeIV,BARTENDER,No blasters! No blaster!
340,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs.
341,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,I don't like the look of this.
342,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
343,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship."
344,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
345,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,Should I have?
346,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!
347,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo?"
348,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions asked."
349,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,What is it? Some kind of local trouble?
350,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.
351,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Well, that's the real trick, isn't it? And it's going to cost you something extra. Ten thousand in advance."
352,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that!
353,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"But who's going to fly it, kid! You?"
354,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have to sit here and listen...
355,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan."
356,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Seventeen, huh!"
357,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Docking bay Ninety-four.
358,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,Ninety-four.
359,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
360,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER,"All right, we'll check it out."
361,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready.
362,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,You'll have to sell your speeder.
363,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again.
364,SW_EpisodeIV,GREEDO,"Going somewhere, Solo?"
365,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money."
366,SW_EpisodeIV,GREEDO,"It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you first."
367,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Yeah, but this time I got the money."
368,SW_EpisodeIV,GREEDO,"If you give it to me, I might forget I found you."
369,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...
370,SW_EpisodeIV,GREEDO,Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.
371,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?
372,SW_EpisodeIV,GREEDO,You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.
373,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Over my dead body.
374,SW_EpisodeIV,GREEDO,That's the idea I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.
375,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Yes, I'll bet you have."
376,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Sorry about the mess.
377,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.
378,SW_EpisodeIV,IMPERIAL OFFICER,The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set?
379,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.
380,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,What do you mean?
381,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.
382,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER,With pleasure.
383,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Lock the door, Artoo."
384,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER,"All right, check that side of the street. It's secure. Move on to the next door."
385,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault."
386,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,You watch your language!
387,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they "
388,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,It will be enough.
389,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well."
390,SW_EpisodeIV,JABBA,"Come on out, Solo!"
391,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"I've been waiting for you, Jabba."
392,SW_EpisodeIV,JABBA,I expected you would be.
393,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,I'm not the type to run.
394,SW_EpisodeIV,JABBA,"Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me? And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together."
395,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,You sent Greedo to blast me.
396,SW_EpisodeIV,JABBA,"Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business. You're too valuable to fry. He was only relaying my concern at your delays. He wasn't going to blast you."
397,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"I think he thought he was. Next time don't send one of those twerps. If you've got something to say to me, come see me yourself."
398,SW_EpisodeIV,JABBA,"Han, Han! If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception. Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship? It's not good business."
399,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra. I just need some more time."
400,SW_EpisodeIV,JABBA,"Put your blasters away. Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you. So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it. If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life."
401,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure."
402,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,What a piece of junk.
403,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some special modifications myself."
404,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here."
405,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Hello, sir."
406,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER,Which way?
407,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER,"All right, men. Load your weapons!"
408,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER,Stop that ship!
409,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER,Blast 'em!
410,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Chewie, get us out of here!"
411,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel."
412,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.
413,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Stay sharp! There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off.
414,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast.
415,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!"
416,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Here's where the fun begins!
417,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,How long before you can make the jump to light speed?
418,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer.
419,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining...
420,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy! Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?"
421,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,What's that flashing?
422,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed."
423,SW_EpisodeIV,MOTTI,We've entered the Alderaan system.
424,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,"Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board."
425,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life!
426,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,to take the responsibility yourself!
427,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,"Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now."
428,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,"The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers."
429,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,"Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan."
430,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly...
431,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system!
432,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where is the Rebel base?
433,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,Dantooine.
434,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,They're on Dantooine.
435,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,"There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready."
436,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,What?
437,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough. 
438,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,No!
439,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,Commence primary ignition.
440,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Are you all right? What's wrong?
441,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.
442,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,You'd better get on with your exercises.
443,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em."
444,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Don't everyone thank me at once.
445,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours."
446,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Now be careful, Artoo."
447,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you.
448,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
449,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid."
450,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.
451,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win."
452,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him."
453,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,You mean it controls your actions?
454,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,Partially. But it also obeys your commands.
455,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid."
456,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"You don't believe in the Force, do you?"
457,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny."
458,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
459,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"I suggest you try it again, Luke."
460,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct."
461,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight?"
462,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.
463,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,Stretch out with your feelings.
464,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"You see, you can do it."
465,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,I call it luck. 
466,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"In my experience, there's no such thing as luck."
467,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against the living? That's something else."
468,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.
469,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote."
470,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world.
471,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,Yes.
472,SW_EpisodeIV,OFFICER CASS,"Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems."
473,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,She lied! She lied to us!
474,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.
475,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,Terminate her... immediately!
476,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines."
477,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts."
478,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,What's going on?
479,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!"
480,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,What do you mean? Where is it?
481,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away."
482,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,What? How?
483,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,Destroyed... by the Empire!
484,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...
485,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,There's another ship coming in.
486,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Maybe they know what happened.
487,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,It's an Imperial fighter.
488,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,It followed us!
489,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,No. It's a short range fighter.
490,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from?
491,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in big trouble."
492,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Not if I can help it. Chewie... jam it's transmissions.
493,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range.
494,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Not for long...
495,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
496,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something..."
497,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us."
498,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Look at him. He's heading for that small moon.
499,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.
500,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,That's no moon! It's a space station.
501,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,It's too big to be a space station.
502,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I have a very bad feeling about this.
503,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,Turn the ship around!
504,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power."
505,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Why are we still moving towards it?
506,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in!
507,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,But there's gotta be something you can do!
508,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight!"
509,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting.
510,SW_EpisodeIV,VOICE OVER DEATH STAR INTERCOM,Clear Bay twenty-three-seven. We are opening the magnetic field.
511,SW_EpisodeIV,OFFICER,To your stations!
512,SW_EpisodeIV,OFFICER,Come with me.
513,SW_EpisodeIV,OFFICER,Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields!
514,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,Yes.
515,SW_EpisodeIV,VOICE,We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
516,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may yet be of some use to us.
517,SW_EpisodeIV,VOICE,Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release charges.
518,SW_EpisodeIV,OFFICER,"There's no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned."
519,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,Did you find any droids?
520,SW_EpisodeIV,OFFICER,"No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned."
521,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship checked.
522,SW_EpisodeIV,OFFICER,"Yes, sir."
523,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...
524,SW_EpisodeIV,OFFICER,Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every part of this ship checked!
525,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments."
526,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam."
527,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,Leave that to me!
528,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!
529,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?
530,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER,"The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go."
531,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?"
532,SW_EpisodeIV,GANTRY OFFICER,"TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy? "
533,SW_EpisodeIV,GANTRY OFFICER,Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do.
534,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here."
535,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
536,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"We found the computer outlet, sir."
537,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.
538,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,He says he's found the main control to the power beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.
539,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
540,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone.
541,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Whatever you say. I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.
542,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I want to go with you.
543,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids."
544,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,But he can...
545,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path from mine. The Force will be with you... always!
546,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Boy you said it, Chewie."
547,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Where did you dig up that old fossil?
548,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Ben is a great man.
549,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Yeah, great at getting us into trouble."
550,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I didn't hear you give any ideas...
551,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up..."
552,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Who do you think...
553,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,What is it?
554,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says \I found her,\ and keepsrepeating, \She's here.\"
555,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Well, who... who has he found?"
556,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Princess Leia.
557,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,The princess? She's here?
558,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Princess?
559,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Where... where is she?
560,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Princess? What's going on?
561,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Level five. Detention block AA-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
562,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Oh, no! We've got to do something."
563,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,What are you talking about?
564,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message. We've got to help her.
565,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here."
566,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way back into the detention block?"
567,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,I'm not going anywhere.
568,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay. "
569,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
570,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,But they're going to kill her!
571,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Better her than me...
572,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,She's rich.
573,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Rich?
574,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be..."
575,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,What?
576,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Well more wealth that you can imagine.
577,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!"
578,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,You'll get it!
579,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,I better!
580,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,You will...
581,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"All right, kid. But you'd better be right about this!"
582,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,All right.
583,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,What's your plan?
584,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?"
585,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on you."
586,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Okay. Han, you put these on."
587,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind."
588,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?"
589,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Lock the door!
590,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,And hope they don't have blasters.
591,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,That isn't very reassuring.
592,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I can't see a thing in this helmet.
593,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,This is not going to work.
594,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Why didn't you say so before?
595,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,I did say so before!
596,SW_EpisodeIV,OFFICER,Where are you taking this... thing?
597,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight.
598,SW_EpisodeIV,OFFICER,I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it.
599,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Look out! He's loose!
600,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,He's going to pull us all apart.
601,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Go get him!
602,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold them here.
603,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Everything is under control. Situation normal.
604,SW_EpisodeIV,INTERCOM VOICE,What happened?
605,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you?"
606,SW_EpisodeIV,INTERCOM VOICE,We're sending a squad up.
607,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Uh, uh, negative, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Large leak... very dangerous."
608,SW_EpisodeIV,INTERCOM VOICE,Who is this? What's your operating number?
609,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Boring conversation anyway.Luke! We're going to have company!
610,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?
611,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you. 
612,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,You're who?
613,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
614,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?
615,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Come on!
616,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,He is here...
617,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so?
618,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
619,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,Surely he must be dead by now.
620,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,Don't underestimate the Force.
621,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,"The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion."
622,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,Yes.
623,SW_EpisodeIV,INTERCOM VOICE,"Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block AA-twenty-three."
624,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,The princess! Put all sections on alert!
625,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.
626,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,"If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape."
627,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,Escape may not his plan. I must face him alone.
628,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Chewie!
629,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Get behind me! Get behind me!
630,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Can't get out that way.
631,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.
632,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness."
633,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,See-Threepio! See-Threepio!
634,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Yes sir?
635,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that? I didn't copy!
636,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way out; all other information on your level is restricted."
637,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER VOICE,Open up in there!
638,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Oh, no!"
639,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,There isn't any other way out.
640,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,I can't hold them off forever! Now what?
641,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,"This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?"
642,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"He's the brains, sweetheart."
643,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Well, I didn't..."
644,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,What the hell are you doing?
645,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,"Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise guy."
646,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get in there and don't worry about it.
647,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her. Get in there!
648,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of here! Get away from there...
649,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,No! wait!
650,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically sealed!
651,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed.
652,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us."
653,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,It could be worse...
654,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,It's worse.
655,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,There's something alive in here!
656,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,That's your imagination.
657,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that?
658,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,What?
659,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Help!
660,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Luke! Luke! Luke!
661,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,Luke!
662,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,"Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this."
663,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed."
664,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Where?
665,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Anywhere! Oh!!
666,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Luke! Luke!
667,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,Grab him!
668,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,What happened?
669,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared..."
670,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,I've got a very bad feeling about this.
671,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,The walls are moving!
672,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,Don't just stand there. Try and brace it with something.
673,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Wait a minute!
674,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be?
675,SW_EpisodeIV,FIRST TROOPER,Take over!See to him! Look there!
676,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them."
677,SW_EpisodeIV,FIRST OFFICER,Follow me! You stand guard.
678,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Come on!
679,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance."
680,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER,All right.
681,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!"
682,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Get to the top!
683,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,I can't 
684,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in?"
685,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured.
686,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Hurry!
687,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner!Get on top of it!
688,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,I'm trying!
689,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be?"
690,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off!"
691,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Are you there, sir?"
692,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Threepio!
693,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,We've had some problems...
694,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy?"
695,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
696,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.
697,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,No. Shut them all down! Hurry!
698,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master!"
699,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Threepio, we're all right!"
700,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,We're all right. You did great.
701,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we?"
702,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.
703,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here."
704,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Well, let's get moving!"
705,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Where are you going?
706,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,"No, wait. They'll hear!"
707,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Come here, you big coward!"
708,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Chewie! Come here!
709,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,"Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay?"
710,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I takeorders from one person! Me!"
711,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,It's a wonder you're still alive.Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
712,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,No reward is worth this.
713,SW_EpisodeIV,OFFICER,Secure this area until the alert is canceled.
714,SW_EpisodeIV,FIRST TROOPER,Give me regular reports.
715,SW_EpisodeIV,FIRST TROOPER,Do you know what's going on?
716,SW_EpisodeIV,SECOND TROOPER,Maybe it's another drill.
717,SW_EpisodeIV,SECOND TROOPER,What was that?
718,SW_EpisodeIV,FIRST TROOPER,"Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it."
719,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,There she is.
720,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"See-Threepio, do you copy?"
721,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"For the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship."
722,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,We're right above you. Stand by.
723,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought.
724,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Nice! Come on!
725,SW_EpisodeIV,FIRST TROOPER,It's them! Blast them!
726,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Get back to the ship!
727,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Where are you going? Come back!
728,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,He certainly has courage.
729,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on!
730,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I think we took a wrong turn.
731,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,There's no lock!
732,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,That oughta hold it for a while.
733,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,"Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends the bridge."
734,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Oh, I think I just blasted it."
735,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,They're coming through!
736,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Here, hold this."
737,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,Here they come!
738,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,For luck!
739,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Where could they be?
740,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER,Close the blast doors!
741,SW_EpisodeIV,TROOPER,Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors!
742,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,"I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete."
743,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,"When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master."
744,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Only a master of evil, Darth."
745,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,"Your powers are weak, old man."
746,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine."
747,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Didn't we just leave this party?
748,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,What kept you?
749,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,We ran into some old friends.
750,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Is the ship all right?
751,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Seems okay, if we can get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission."
752,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Look!
753,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Come on, Artoo, we're going!"
754,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Now's our chance! Go!
755,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,No!
756,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Come on!
757,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,"Come on! Luke, its too late!"
758,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Blast the door! Kid!
759,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Run, Luke! Run!"
760,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it!"
761,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,We're coming up on the sentry ships. Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns!
762,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I can't believe he's gone.
763,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,There wasn't anything you could have done.
764,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!"
765,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!"
766,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,Here they come!
767,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,They're coming in too fast!
768,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Oooh!
769,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,We've lost lateral controls.
770,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Don't worry, she'll hold together."
771,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"You hear me, baby? Hold together!"
772,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Got him! I got him!
773,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Great kid! Don't get cocky.
774,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,There are still two more of them out there!
775,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,That's it! We did it!
776,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,We did it!
777,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,Help! I think I'm melting!This is all your fault.
778,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,Are they away?
779,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,They have just made the jump into hyperspace.
780,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,"You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work."
781,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself."
782,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,"That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape."
783,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Easy... you call that easy?
784,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,Their tracking us!
785,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Not this ship, sister."
786,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,At least the information in Artoo is still intact.
787,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,What's so important? What's he carrying?
788,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,"The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet!"
789,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money!"
790,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,"You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!"
791,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.
792,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I care!
793,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"So... what do you think of her, Han?"
794,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"I'm trying not to, kid!"
795,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Good...
796,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me..."
797,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,No!
798,SW_EpisodeIV,WILLARD,You're safe! We had feared the worst.
799,SW_EpisodeIV,WILLARD,"When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father."
800,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,"We don't have time for our sorrows, commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here.It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope."
801,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,Yes.
802,SW_EpisodeIV,DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE,We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.
803,SW_EpisodeIV,DODONNA,The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet.Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.
804,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD LEADER,"Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?"
805,SW_EpisodeIV,DODONNA,"Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station."
806,SW_EpisodeIV,DODONNA,"The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station."
807,SW_EpisodeIV,DODONNA,"Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes."
808,SW_EpisodeIV,WEDGE,"That's impossible, even for a computer."
809,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,It's not impossible. I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters.
810,SW_EpisodeIV,DODONNA,Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!
811,SW_EpisodeIV,DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE,Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.
812,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.
813,SW_EpisodeIV,MAN,"All flight troops, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations."
814,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?
815,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. I could use you."
816,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them."
817,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain'tmy idea of courage. It's more like suicide."
818,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?"
819,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!"
820,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing.
821,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,What's wrong?
822,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. "
823,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him.
824,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I only wish Ben were here.
825,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you get here... are you going out with us?!
826,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there with you! Listen, have I got some stories to tell..."
827,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-five?
828,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,"Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories."
829,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,"I met your father once when I was just a boy. He was a great pilot. You'll do all right. If you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right."
830,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Thank you, sir. I'll try."
831,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,"I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back. All right?"
832,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs."
833,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,"You did, all right. It's going to be like old times Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped!"
834,SW_EpisodeIV,CHIEF,This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one?
835,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together.You okay, Artoo?"
836,SW_EpisodeIV,CHIEF,"Okay, easy she goes!"
837,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Hang on tight, Artoo, you've got to come back."
838,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?"
839,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Luke, the Force will be with you."
840,SW_EpisodeIV,MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE,"Stand-by alert. Death Star approaching. Estimated time to firing range, fifteen minutes."
841,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,All wings report in.
842,SW_EpisodeIV,RED TEN,Red Ten standing by.
843,SW_EpisodeIV,RED SEVEN,Red Seven standing by.
844,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,Red Three standing by.
845,SW_EpisodeIV,PORKINS,Red Six standing by.
846,SW_EpisodeIV,RED NINE,Red Nine standing by.
847,SW_EpisodeIV,WEDGE,Red Two standing by.
848,SW_EpisodeIV,RED ELEVEN,Red Eleven standing by.
849,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Red Five standing by.
850,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,Lock S-foils in attack position.
851,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,We're passing through their magnetic field.
852,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,Hold tight!
853,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,Switch your deflectors on.
854,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,Double front!
855,SW_EpisodeIV,WEDGE,Look at the size of that thing!
856,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,"Cut the chatter, Red Two."
857,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,"Accelerate to attack speed. This is it, boys!"
858,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD LEADER,"Red Leader, this is Gold Leader."
859,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,"I copy, Gold Leader."
860,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD LEADER,We're starting for the target shaft now.
861,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,We're in position. I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire.
862,SW_EpisodeIV,WEDGE,"Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-threedegrees."
863,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,I see it. Stay low. 
864,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,This is Red Five! I'm going in!
865,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,"Luke, pull up!"
866,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,Are you all right?
867,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"I got a little cooked, but I'm okay."
868,SW_EpisodeIV,ASTRO-OFFICER,"We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!"
869,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters.
870,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,"Luke, let me know when you're going in."
871,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I'm on my way in now...
872,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower.
873,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I'm on it.
874,SW_EpisodeIV,CONTROL OFFICER,"Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals. Enemy fighters coming your way."
875,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,My scope's negative. I don't see anything.
876,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,"Keep up your visual scanning. With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up."
877,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,Biggs! You've picked one up... watch it!
878,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,I can't see it! Where is he?!
879,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,"He's on me tight, I can't shake him... I can't shake him."
880,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in."
881,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Got him!
882,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me!
883,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,Pull in! Luke... pull in!
884,SW_EpisodeIV,WEDGE,"Watch your back, Luke!"
885,SW_EpisodeIV,WEDGE,"Watch your back! Fighter's above you, coming in!"
886,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"I'm hit, but not bad."
887,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Artoo, see what you can do with it. Hang on back there."
888,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,Red Six...
889,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,Can you see Red Five?
890,SW_EpisodeIV,RED TEN,"There's a heavy fire zone on this side. Red Five, where are you?"
891,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I can't shake him!
892,SW_EpisodeIV,WEDGE,"I'm on him, Luke!"
893,SW_EpisodeIV,WEDGE,Hold on!
894,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Blast it! Wedge where are you?
895,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Thanks, Wedge."
896,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,"Good shooting, Wedge!"
897,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD LEADER,Red Leader...
898,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD LEADER,... This is Gold Leader. We're starting out attack run.
899,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,"I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position."
900,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,Stay in attack formation!
901,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD LEADER,The exhaust post is...
902,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD LEADER,... marked and locked in!
903,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD LEADER,Switch power to front deflection screens.
904,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD LEADER,"How many guns do you think, Gold Five?"
905,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD FIVE,"I'd say about twenty guns. Some on the surface, some on the towers."
906,SW_EpisodeIV,MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE,Death Star will be in range in five minutes. 
907,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD LEADER,Switch to targeting computer.
908,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD TWO,Computer's locked. Getting a signal.
909,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD TWO,The guns... they've stopped!
910,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD FIVE,Stabilize your rear deflectors. Watch for enemy fighters.
911,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD LEADER,They've coming in! Three marks at two ten.
912,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,I'll take them myself! Cover me!
913,SW_EpisodeIV,WINGMAN,"Yes, sir."
914,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD LEADER,I can't maneuver!
915,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD FIVE,Stay on target.
916,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD LEADER,We're too close.
917,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD FIVE,Stay on target!
918,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD LEADER,Loosen up!
919,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD FIVE,Gold Five to Red Leader...
920,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD FIVE,"Lost Tiree, lost Dutch."
921,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,"I copy, Gold Five."
922,SW_EpisodeIV,GOLD FIVE,They came from behind....
923,SW_EpisodeIV,OFFICER,"We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship standing by?"
924,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,Evacuate? In out moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances!
925,SW_EpisodeIV,VOICE,"Rebel base, three minutes and closing."
926,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,"Red Group, this is Red Leader."
927,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,Rendezvous at mark six point one.
928,SW_EpisodeIV,WEDGE,This is Red Two. Flying towards you.
929,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,"Red Three, standing by."
930,SW_EpisodeIV,DODONNA,"Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep half your group out of range for the next run."
931,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,"Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Hold up here and wait for my signal... to start your run."
932,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,This is it!
933,SW_EpisodeIV,RED TEN,We should be able to see it by now.
934,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,Keep your eyes open for those fighters!
935,SW_EpisodeIV,RED TEN,There's too much interference!
936,SW_EpisodeIV,RED TEN,"Red Five, can you see them from where you are?"
937,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,No sign of any... wait!
938,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Coming in point three five.
939,SW_EpisodeIV,RED TEN,I see them.
940,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,I'm in range.
941,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,Target's coming up!
942,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,Just hold them off for a few seconds.
943,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,Close up formation.
944,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,Almost there!
945,SW_EpisodeIV,RED TEN,You'd better let her loose.
946,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,Almost there!
947,SW_EpisodeIV,RED TEN,I can't hold them!
948,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,It's away!
949,SW_EpisodeIV,RED NINE,It's a hit!
950,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,Negative.
951,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,"Negative! It didn't go in, it just impacted on the surface."
952,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Red Leader, we're right above you. Turn to point..."
953,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,... oh-five; we'll cover for you.
954,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,Stay there...
955,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,... I just lost my starboard engine.
956,SW_EpisodeIV,RED LEADER,Get set up for your attack run.
957,SW_EpisodeIV,DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE,"Rebel base, one minute and closing."
958,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up. We're going in. We're going in full throttle."
959,SW_EpisodeIV,WEDGE,"Right with you, boss."
960,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,"Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time?"
961,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home.
962,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,We'll stay back far enough to cover you.
963,SW_EpisodeIV,WEDGE,"My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port! Are you sure the computer can hit it?"
964,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Watch yourself! Increase speed full throttle!
965,SW_EpisodeIV,WEDGE,What about that tower?
966,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,You worry about those fighters! I'll worry about the tower!
967,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Artoo... that, that stabilizer's broken loose again! See if you can't lock it down!"
968,SW_EpisodeIV,WEDGE,I'm hit! I can't stay with you.
969,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Get clear, Wedge."
970,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,You can't do any more good back there!
971,SW_EpisodeIV,WEDGE,Sorry!
972,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,Let him go! Stay on the leader!
973,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,"Hurry, Luke, they're coming in much faster this time. I can't hold them!"
974,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Artoo, try and increase the power!"
975,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,"Hurry up, Luke!"
976,SW_EpisodeIV,BIGGS,Wait!
977,SW_EpisodeIV,DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE,"Rebel base, thirty seconds and closing."
978,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,I'm on the leader.
979,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Hang on, Artoo!"
980,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Use the Force, Luke."
981,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Let go, Luke."
982,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,The Force is strong with this one!
983,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Luke, trust me."
984,SW_EpisodeIV,BASE VOICE,"His computer's off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What's wrong?"
985,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,Nothing. I'm all right.
986,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I've lost Artoo!
987,SW_EpisodeIV,MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE,The Death Star has cleared the planet. The Death Star has cleared the planet.
988,SW_EpisodeIV,DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE,"Rebel base, in range."
989,SW_EpisodeIV,TARKIN,You may fire when ready.
990,SW_EpisodeIV,DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE,Commence primary ignition.
991,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,I have you now.
992,SW_EpisodeIV,VADER,What?
993,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Yahoo!
994,SW_EpisodeIV,WINGMAN,Look out!
995,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"You're all clear, kid."
996,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Now let's blow this thing and go home!
997,SW_EpisodeIV,INTERCOM VOICE,Stand by to fire at Rebel base.
998,SW_EpisodeIV,INTERCOM VOICE,Standing by.
999,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Great shot, kid. That was one in a million."
1000,SW_EpisodeIV,BEN,"Remember, the Force will be with you... always."
1001,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,Luke! Luke! Luke!
1002,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,Hey! Hey!
1003,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,I knew you'd come back! I just knew it!
1004,SW_EpisodeIV,HAN,"Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward."
1005,SW_EpisodeIV,LEIA,"Hey, I knew there was more to you than money."
1006,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,"Oh, no!"
1007,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say something!You can repair him, can't you?"
1008,SW_EpisodeIV,TECHNICIAN,We'll get to work on him right away.
1009,SW_EpisodeIV,THREEPIO,"You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them."
1010,SW_EpisodeIV,LUKE,He'll be all right.
