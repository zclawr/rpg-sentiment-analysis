Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf sent us on our long journey we find     ourselves looking upon a familiar sight."

53,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Ahaha!
54,The Return of the King,MERRY,"Welcome, my lords to Isengard!"
55,The Return of the King,GIMLI,You young rascals. A merry hunt you've led us on and now we find you     feasting and ' and smoking!
56,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Hmm?
57,The Return of the King,FRODO,"How do you pick up the threads of an old life? How do you go on, when in     your heart you begin to understand there is no going back? There are some     things that time cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep, that have taken     hold."
58,The Return of the King,SAM,Mr Frodo? What is it?
59,The Return of the King,FRODO,It's been four years to the day since Weathertop Sam. It's never really     healed.
60,The Return of the King,SAM,", There and Back Again, a Hobbits tale     by Bilbo Baggins and the Lord of the Rings by Frodo Baggins. You finished     it."
61,The Return of the King,FRODO,Not quite. There's room for a little more.
62,The Return of the King,FRODO,"Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end. That each of us must     come and go in the telling. Bilbo's story was now over. There would be no     more journeys for him. , save one."
63,The Return of the King,BILBO,"Tell me again lad, where are we going?"
64,The Return of the King,FRODO,To the harbour Bilbo. The elves have accorded you a special honour. A place     on the last ship to leave Middle Earth.
65,The Return of the King,BILBO,"Frodo, any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again? The one I gave you?"
66,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"We are sitting on a field of     victory enjoying a few well earned comforts , The salted pork is particularly good."
67,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Salted pork'
68,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Hobbits!
69,The Return of the King,MERRY,We're under orders from Treebeard who's taken over management of Isengard.
70,The Return of the King,TREEBEARD,"Hoooom, young master Gandalf, I'm glad you've come. Wood and water,     stock and stone I can master, but there is a Wizard to manage here locked in     his tower"
71,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,", Show yourself."
72,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Be careful. Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous."
73,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Well then let's just have his head and be done with it.
74,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"No, we need him alive. We need him to talk."
75,The Return of the King,SARUMAN,"You have fought many wars and slain many men Theoden King and made peace afterwards. Can we not take counsel together as we once did, my old friend?Can we not have peace you and I?"
76,The Return of the King,THEODEN,We shall have peace'. We shall have peace when you answer for the     burning of the Westfold and the children that lie dead there! We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead against the gates of the Hornburg' are avenged! When you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows' we shall have peace!
77,The Return of the King,SARUMAN,Gibbets and crows! Dotard! What do you want Gandalf Grahame? Let me guess' the key of Orthanc? Or perhaps the keys of Barad D'r itself? Along with the crowns of the seven Kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!
78,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Your treachery has already cost many lives. Thousands more are now at     risk. But you could save them Saruman. You were deep in the enemy's counsel.
79,The Return of the King,FRODO,I'm sorry uncle. I'm afraid I lost it.
80,The Return of the King,BILBO,"Oh, pity. (He sighs.) I would have like to have held it one last time."
81,The Return of the King,BILBO,Oh! Well here is a sight I have never seen before.
82,The Return of the King,GALADRIL,The power of the three rings is ended. The time has come for the dominion of     men.
83,The Return of the King,ELROND,I Aear c'n ven na mar.
84,The Return of the King,BILBO,I think I'm quite ready for another adventure.
85,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Farewell my brave Hobbits. , My work is now finished.    ,Here at last, on the     shores of the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship. , I will not say do not weep for not all     tears are an evil. , It is time Frodo."
86,The Return of the King,SAM,What does he mean?
87,The Return of the King,FRODO,"We set out to save the Shire Sam and it has been saved, but not for me."
88,The Return of the King,SAM,", You don't mean that. You can't     leave."
89,The Return of the King,FRODO,The last pages are for you Sam.
90,The Return of the King,SARUMAN,"So you have come here for information. I have some for you.    ,Something festers in the heart of Middle Earth. Something that you have failed to see. But the great eye has seen it! Even now he presses his advantage. His attack will come soon.     ,     You are all going to die! But you know this don't you Gandalf? You cannot think that this Ranger will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor. This exile, crept from the shadows will never be crowned King. ,Gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those who are closest to him' those he professes to love! Tell me, what words of comfort did you give the Halfling before you sent him to his doom? The path that you have set him on can only lead to death."
91,The Return of the King,GIMLI,I've heard enough! Shoot him! Stick an arrow in his gob!
92,The Return of the King,GANDALF,No! Come down Saruman and your life will be spared!
93,The Return of the King,SARUMAN,Save your pity and your mercy. I have no use for it!
94,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Saruman'.. your staff is broken!
95,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Grima! You need not follow him! You were not always as you are now. You were once a man of Rohan. Come down.
96,The Return of the King,SARUMAN,A man of Rohan? What is the house of Rohan but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs? The victory at Helms Deep does not belong to you Theoden Horse Master. You are a lesser son of greater sires!
97,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Grima'. Come down! Be free of him!
98,The Return of the King,SARUMAN,Free? He will never be free!
99,The Return of the King,GRIMA,No!
100,The Return of the King,FRODO VOICE OVER,"My dear Sam, you cannot always be torn in two. , You will     have to be one and whole for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be     and to do. Your part in the story will go on."
101,The Return of the King,SAM,"Well, I'm back."
102,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,I didn't think it would end this way.
103,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"End?  No, the journey doesn't end here.  Death is just another path, one that we all must take.    ,  The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back and all turns to silvered glass.  And then you see it."
104,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,What?  Gandalf?  See what?
105,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"White shores and beyond,  a far green country under a swift sunrise."
106,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"Well, , that's not  so bad."
107,The Return of the King,GANDALF,No.  No it isn't.
108,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Rally to me!  To meeee!

112,The Return of the King,EOWYN,It grows so cold.
113,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,It's just the damp of the first spring rain.
114,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,I do not believe this darkness will endure.
115,The Return of the King,SAM,"Look!  The Orcs, they're moving off!"
116,The Return of the King,SARUMAN,Get down cur!
117,The Return of the King,GRIMA,Ah!
118,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Saruman! You were deep in the enemy's counsel. Tell us what you know!
119,The Return of the King,SARUMAN,You withdraw your guard and I will tell you where your doom will be     decided. I will not be held prisoner here!
120,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Send word to all our allies and to every corner of Middle Earth that     still stands free. The enemy moves against us. We need to know where he will     strike.

144,The Return of the King,SOLDIERS ON GATE,"Come on, come on!"
145,The Return of the King,GOTHMOG,Move into the city. Kill all in your path.
146,The Return of the King,ORC,Break it up!  Break it up!
147,The Return of the King,GENERAL,Oy!  I'll have your guts if you don't shut this rabble down!
148,The Return of the King,FRODO,Go Sam.  Now!
149,The Return of the King,GENERAL,Move along scum!

212,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion."
213,The Return of the King,MOUTH OF SAURON,And who is this?  Isildur's heir?  It takes more to make a King than a broken Elvish blade.
214,The Return of the King,GIMLI,I guess that concludes negotiations.
215,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,I do not believe it.  I will not.
216,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,This army.
217,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,In there.

222,The Return of the King,FRODO,I can't go back.
223,The Return of the King,FRODO,What's that smell.
224,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,Orcses' filth. Orcses come in here sometimes.

249,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"NO! , Aaaaaaaaa."
250,The Return of the King,FRODO,I'm so sorry Sam.     I'm so sorry.
251,The Return of the King,GIMLI,What kind of army would linger in such a place?
252,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,"One that is cursed. Long ago the men of the mountains swore an oath to     the last King of Gondor , to come to his aid, to fight. But when     the time came, when Gondor's need was dire, they fled vanishing into the     darkness of the mountain. And so Isildur cursed them, never to rest until     they had fulfilled their pledge. Who shall call them from the grey twilight,     the forgotten people? The heir of him to whom the oath they swore. From the     North shall he come, need shall drive him. He shall pass the door to the     Paths of the Dead."
253,The Return of the King,GIMLI,The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.
254,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,"The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead , and the dead keep it. The     way is shut."
255,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Brego!
256,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,I do not fear death!
257,The Return of the King,GALADRIEL,"This task was appointed to you, Frodo of the Shire. If you do not find a     way, no one will."
258,The Return of the King,EOMER,"The scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded. The lower level's in flames. Everywhere, legions of the enemy advance."
259,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Time is against us. Make ready!
260,The Return of the King,EOWYN,"Take heart Merry. , It will soon be over"
261,The Return of the King,MERRY,"My lady. You are fair and brave and have much to live for    , and many who love you. I     know it is too late to turn aside. I know there is not much point now in     hoping. If I were a knight of Rohan capable of great deeds'but I'm not. I'm a Hobbit. And I know I can't save Middle Earth. I just want to help my friends; Frodo, Sam, Pippin. More than anything I wish I could see them again."
262,The Return of the King,EOMER,Prepare to move out!
263,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Make haste. We ride through the night.
264,The Return of the King,EOWYN,To battle
265,The Return of the King,MERRY,To battle
266,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Back to the gate! Hurry!
267,The Return of the King,GIMLI,"Well this is a thing unheard of. An elf will go underground, where a     dwarf dare not. Oh. Oh, I'd never hear the end of it."
268,The Return of the King,THEODEN,We must ride light and swift. It is a long road ahead and man and beast     must reach the end with the strength to fight.
269,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Little Hobbits do not belong in war Master Meriadoc.
270,The Return of the King,MERRY,All my friends have gone to battle. I would be ashamed to be left     behind.
271,The Return of the King,THEODEN,It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith and none of my riders can bear     you as a burdon.
272,The Return of the King,MERRY,I want to fight!
273,The Return of the King,THEODEN,I will say no more.
274,The Return of the King,EOWYN,Ride with me!
275,The Return of the King,MERRY,My lady!
276,The Return of the King,EOMER,"Form up, move out! Form up, move out!"
277,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Ride! Ride now to Gondor.
278,The Return of the King,GIMLI,What is it? What do you see?
279,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,I see shapes of men and of horses.
280,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Where?
281,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,"Pale banners like shreds of cloud. , Spears rise     like winter thickets through a shroud of mist. The dead are following. They     have been summoned."
282,The Return of the King,GIMLI,"The dead?     Summoned? I knew that! Huh. Huh. , Very good. Very good. , Legolas!"
283,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Do not look down.
284,The Return of the King,KING OF THE DEAD,Who enters my domain?
285,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,One who will have your allegiance.
286,The Return of the King,KING OF THE DEAD,The dead do not suffer the living to pass.
287,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,You will suffer me!
288,The Return of the King,KING OF THE DEAD,The way is shut! It was made by those who are dead. And the dead keep     it. (The Ghostly army closes around them) The way is shut! Now you must die!
289,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,I summon you to     fulfil your oath!
290,The Return of the King,KING OF THE DEAD,None but the King of Gondor may command me!
291,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,"Make way for the King!  Make way, the King is here"
292,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,My lord!
293,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,Hail to you sire!
294,The Return of the King,GRIMBOLD,I bring 500 men from the Westfold my lord.
295,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,"We have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King."
296,The Return of the King,KING OF THE DEAD,That blade was broken!
297,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"It has been remade. ,     Fight for us and regain your honour. What say you? ,What say you?"
298,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Ach! You waste your time Aragorn. They had no honour in life and they     have none now in death.
299,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"I am Isildur's heir. Fight for me and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.    ,What say you?"
300,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"You have my word! Fight and I will release you from this living death!    , What say you?"
301,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Stand you traitors!
302,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Out!
303,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Legolas! Run!
304,The Return of the King,KING OF THE DEAD,We fight!
305,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,"Open the gate, quick!"
306,The Return of the King,IROLAS,Quick! Hurry!
307,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,Faramir! Say not that he has fallen.
308,The Return of the King,IROLAS,They were outnumbered! None survived.
309,The Return of the King,GOTHMOG,Fear. The city is rank with it! Ha ha ha ha. Let us ease their pain.     Release the prisoners!
310,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Where are the riders from Snowbourn?
311,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,None have come my lord.
312,The Return of the King,THEODEN,"Six thousand spears, less than half of what I had hoped for."
313,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.
314,The Return of the King,THEODEN,More will come
315,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.  ,  We have until dawn then we must ride."
316,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,The horses are restless and the men are quiet.
317,The Return of the King,EOMER,They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.
318,The Return of the King,GIMLI,That road there where does that lead?
319,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,"It is the road to the Dimholt, the door under the mountain."
320,The Return of the King,ORC,"Catapults! , ha ha ha."
321,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"My sons are spent! ,     My line has ended!"
322,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,He's alive!
323,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,The     house of Stewards has failed.
324,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,He needs medicine my lord!
325,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,My line has ended!
326,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,My lord!
327,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,Rohan has deserted us!
328,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"Theoden's betrayed me! ABANDON YOUR POSTS! ,FLEE! FLEE FOR YOUR LIVES!"
329,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Prepare for battle. Hurry men! To the wall! Defend the wall! Over here!     Return to your posts.
330,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Send these foul beasts into the Abyss.
331,The Return of the King,GOTHMOG,Stay where you are!
332,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,We need more rubble!
333,The Return of the King,EOMER,None who venture there ever return.  That mountain is evil.
334,The Return of the King,GIMLI,"Aragorn!  ,      Let's find some food."
335,The Return of the King,EOWYN,There.  A true esquire of Rohan.
336,The Return of the King,MERRY,"I'm ready!  , Sorry.  It isn't all that dangerous.  It's not     even sharp."
337,The Return of the King,EOWYN,"To the smithy, go!"
338,The Return of the King,EOMER,You should not encourage him.
339,The Return of the King,EOWYN,You should not doubt him.
340,The Return of the King,EOMER,"I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm."
341,The Return of the King,EOWYN,Why should Merry be left behind?  He has as much cause to go to war as     you.  Why can he not fight for those he loves?
342,The Return of the King,EOMER,"You know as little of war as that Hobbit.   When the fear takes him    , and the blood and the     screams and the horror of battle take hold.  Do you think he would stand and     fight?  He would flee.  And he would be right to do so.     ,  War is the     province of men Eowyn."
343,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,Sir?  King Theoden awaits you my lord.
344,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,Watch out!
345,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,Down to the lower levels quick!
346,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,Double up men!
347,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Hold them back, do not give in to fear. Stand to your posts. Fight!"
348,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Not at the towers! Aim for the trolls, kill the trolls!"
349,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Bring them down!
350,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Fight them back! ,Peregrin Took! Go back to the Citadel."
351,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,They called us out to fight.
352,The Return of the King,GANDALF,This is no place for a Hobbit!
353,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Guard of the Citadel indeed! , Now back up the hill     quickly. Quick!"
354,The Return of the King,GOTHMOG,What are you doing you useless scum?
355,The Return of the King,ORC,The door wont give. It's too strong.
356,The Return of the King,THEODEN,I take my leave.
357,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,My lord Elrond
358,The Return of the King,ELROND,I come on behalf of one whom I love.  Arwen is dying.  She will not long     survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor.  The light of the evenstar is     failing.  As Sauron's power grows her strength wanes.  Arwen's life is now     tied to the fate of the Ring.  The Shadow is upon us Aragorn.  The end has     come.
359,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"It will not be our end, but his."
360,The Return of the King,ELROND,"You ride to war     but not to victory.  Sauron's armies ride on Minas Tirith, this you know.      But in secret he sends another force, which will attack, from the river.    , A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the South.  They will be     in the city in two days.  You're outnumbered Aragorn.  You need more men."
361,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,There are none.
362,The Return of the King,ELROND,There are those that dwell in the mountain.
363,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"Murderers, traitors. You would call upon them to fight?  They believe in     nothing.  They answer to no one"
364,The Return of the King,ELROND,"They will answer to the King of Gondor.  , And'ril, the Flame of the West, forged from the shards of     Narsil."
365,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil.
366,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.
367,The Return of the King,ELROND,The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army     more deadly than any that walks this earth.  Put aside the Ranger.  Become     who you were born to be 'nen i-Estel Edain.
368,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,'-chebin Estel anim.
369,The Return of the King,EOWYN,Why are you doing this?  The war lies to the East.  You cannot leave on     the eve of battle.  You cannot abandon the men.
370,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,What were you thinking Peregrin Took?  What service can a Hobbit offer     such a great lord of men?
371,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,",  It was     well done.  A generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel.     ,     You are to join the tower guard."
372,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,I didn't think they would find any livery that would  fit me.
373,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,It once belonged to a young boy of the city.  A very foolish one who     wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending his studies.
374,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,This was yours?
375,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,"Yes, it was mine.  My father had it made for me."
376,The Return of the King,GOTHMOG,Get back there and smash it down!
377,The Return of the King,ORC,But nothing can breach it!
378,The Return of the King,GOTHMOG,"Grond will breach it! , Bring out the wolf's head."
379,The Return of the King,ORCS,"Grond, Grond, Grond, Grond,     Grond!"
380,The Return of the King,ORCS,"Grond, Grond, Grond, Grond!"
381,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Eowyn'
382,The Return of the King,EOWYN,We need you here.
383,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Why have you come?
384,The Return of the King,EOWYN,Do you not know?
385,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,It is but a shadow and a thought that you love.  I cannot give you what     you seek.
386,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,I have wished you joy since first I saw you.
387,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Just where do you     think you're off to?
388,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Not this time.  This time you must stay Gimli.
389,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Hmmmm
390,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness of     dwarves?
391,The Return of the King,GIMLI,You might as well accept it.  We're going with you laddie.  Aragorn     smiles.
392,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,"What's happening, where is he going?  I don't understand.  (, Lord Aragorn!  Why does     he leave on the eve of battle?"
393,The Return of the King,GAMLING,He leaves because there is no hope.
394,The Return of the King,THEODEN,He leaves because he must.
395,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"Well, I'm taller than you were then.  Though, I'm not likely to grow     anymore, except sideways."
396,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,"It never fitted me either.  Boromir was always the soldier.     ,  They were so alike he and     my father.  Proud, stubborn even, but strong."
397,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,I think you have strength of a different kind.  And one day your father     will see it.
398,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor in peace or war, in living     or dying, from , ' from this hour henceforth     until my lord release me or death take me."
399,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"And I shall not forget it! ,  nor fail to reward  that which is given.     ,      Fealty with love.  ,      Valour with honour.  Disloyalty with vengeance.      ,      I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defences.  Defences     that your brother long held intact."
400,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,What would you have me do?
401,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,I will not yield the River and Pellenor unfought.  Osgiliath must be     retaken.
402,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,My lord Osgiliath is over run.
403,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,Much must be risked in war.    Is there a Captain here who still has the     courage to do his lord's will?
404,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,You wish now that our places had been exchanged.  That I had died and     Boromir had lived.
405,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"Yes, I wish that."
406,The Return of the King,GAMLING,To few have come.  We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.
407,The Return of the King,THEODEN,"No, we cannot.  But we will meet them in battle nonetheless."
408,The Return of the King,THEODEN,"I have left instruction. , The people are to follow your rule in     my stead.     Take up my seat in the Golden Hall. Long may you defend Edoras, if the     battle goes ill."
409,The Return of the King,EOWYN,What other duty would you have me do my lord?
410,The Return of the King,THEODEN,"Duty? ,     no. , I     would have you smile again, not grieve for those whose time has come. You     shall live to see these days renewed , ' and no more despair"
411,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,"Since you are robbed of Boromir I will do what I can in his stead.     ,     If I should return, think better of me father."
412,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,That will depend on the manner of your return.
413,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,Ech!
414,The Return of the King,SAM,What are you up to?  Sneaking off are we?
415,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Sneaking?  Sneaking?  Fat Hobbit is always so polite.  Smeagol shows     them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say 'sneak!'  Sneak?      Very nice friend, oh yes my precious very nice , very nice!"
416,The Return of the King,SAM,Alright!  Alright!  You just startled me is all.  What were you doing?
417,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,Sneaking.
418,The Return of the King,SAM,"Fine, have it your own way.  ,  I'm sorry to wake you Mr Frodo but we have to be     moving on."
419,The Return of the King,FRODO,It's dark still.
420,The Return of the King,SAM,"It's always dark here.  ,  It's gone!     , The elven bread!"
421,The Return of the King,FRODO,What?  That's all we have left!
422,The Return of the King,MADRIL,We can't hold them.  The city is lost.
423,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,Tell the men to break cover.  We ride for Minas Tirith.
424,The Return of the King,DAMROD,Nazg'l!
425,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,Take cover!  Nazgul!  Fall     back.  Fall back to Minas Tirith!
426,The Return of the King,SAM,He took it.  He must have.
427,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Smeagol?  No, no, not poor Smeagol.  Smeagol hates nasty elf bread."
428,The Return of the King,SAM,You're a lying rat!  What did you do with it?
429,The Return of the King,FRODO,"He doesn't     eat it. , He can't have taken     it."
430,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Look, what's this?  ,  Crumbs on his jacketses.  He took it! ,He took it! ,  I've seen him, he's always stuffing his face when master's     not looking."
431,The Return of the King,SAM,"That's a filthy lie!  ,      You stinking, two faced sneak!"
432,The Return of the King,FRODO,Sam!
433,The Return of the King,SAM,Call me'
434,The Return of the King,FRODO,Stop it!
435,The Return of the King,SAM,I'll kill him!
436,The Return of the King,FRODO,"Sam, no!"
437,The Return of the King,SAM,"Oh my!   I'm sorry.  I didn't mean it to go so far.  I was just     so, so angry!  Here just' let's just rest a bit."
438,The Return of the King,FRODO,I'm all right.
439,The Return of the King,SAM,"No.  No you're not all right, you're exhausted.  It's that Gollum.  It's     this place.  It's that thing around your neck.  , I could help a bit.  I could carry it for     a while ,,     carry it for a while ,      I could carry it' I could carry it' Share the load' share the load' share     the load"
440,The Return of the King,FRODO,Get away!
441,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,"Fall back!  ,  Retreat!  Retreat!  Run for your lives!"
442,The Return of the King,GOTHMOG,The age of men is over.  The time of the Orc has come.
443,The Return of the King,SOLDIERS,"Keep going.  It's the Nazgul.  Take cover my lord.     ,     It's coming."
444,The Return of the King,SOLDIERS IN MINAS TIRITH,Its Mithrandir!  The White Rider!
445,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,Pull!
446,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,"Mithrandir!  ,     They broke through our defences.  They've taken the bridge and the West     bank.  Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river."
447,The Return of the King,IROLAS,It is as the Lord Denethor predicted!  Long has he foreseen this doom!
448,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Foreseen and done nothing!
449,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Faramir?  This is not the first Halfling to have crossed your path.
450,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,No.
451,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,You've seen Frodo and Sam?
452,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Where?  When?
453,The Return of the King,SAM,"I don't want to keep it.  , I just want to help."
454,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,See?  See?  He wants it for himself.
455,The Return of the King,SAM,"Shut up you!  ,  Go away!  Get     out of here!"
456,The Return of the King,FRODO,"No Sam!  It's you!  ,      I'm sorry Sam."
457,The Return of the King,SAM,But he's a liar!  He's poisoned     you against me.
458,The Return of the King,FRODO,You can't help me any more.
459,The Return of the King,SAM,You don't mean that.
460,The Return of the King,FRODO,Go home.
461,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Faramir!  Faramir!     , Your     father's will has turned to madness.  Do not throw away your life so     rashly."
462,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,"Where does my allegiance lie if not here?  This is the city of the men     of N'menor.  I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty, her memory,     her wisdom."
463,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Your father loves you Faramir.  ,  He will remember it before the end."
464,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,Can you sing Master Hobbit?
465,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"well, yes.  At least well     enough for my own people.  But we have no songs for great halls and evil     times."
466,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift."
467,The Two Towers,GANDALF,The battle for Helm's Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
468,The Two Towers,GANDALF,(looking back out to Mordor) All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...
469,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,"In Ithilien.  Not two days ago.  Gandalf, they're taking the road to the     Morgul vale."
470,The Return of the King,GANDALF,And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.
471,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,What does that mean? What's wrong?  He looks at Gandalf.
472,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Faramir tell me everything.  Tell me all you know.
473,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,This is how you would serve your city?  You would risk its utter     ruin?
474,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,I did what I judged to be right.
475,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"What you judged to be right!  You sent the Ring of power into Mordor in     the hands of a witless Halfling!  It should have been brought back to the     citadel to be kept safe. Hidden.  Dark and deep in the vaults' not to be     used.  ,      unless, at the uttermost end of need."
476,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,I would not use the Ring.  Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin and     I alone could save her.
477,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious as a King of old.       Boromir would have remembered his father's need.   He would have brought me     a kingly gift
478,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,Boromir would not have brought the Ring.   He would have stretched     out his hand to this thing and taking it he would have fallen.
479,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"And why should your songs be unfit for my halls?  Come, sing me a song."
480,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"Home is behind, The world ahead, ,  And     there are many paths to tread, Through shadow, to the edge of night    ,      Until the stars are all alight. ,  Mist and shadow     cloud and shade, All shall fade, All shall , 'fade."
481,The Return of the King,ORCS,"March, march!   March, march march!"
482,The Two Towers,GANDALF VOICEOVER,...somewhere in the wilderness.
483,The Two Towers,SAM,I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
484,The Two Towers,FRODO,What?
485,The Two Towers,SAM,"I wonder if people will ever say,      ""Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring.""      And they'll say,      ""Yes! That's one of my favourite stories.""      ""Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad? ""      ""Yes, my boy. ,The most famousest of Hobbits.      And that's saying a lot."","
486,The Two Towers,FRODO,"Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:      ""Samwise the Brave.""      I want to hear more about Sam."
487,The Two Towers,FRODO,Frodo wouldn't have got far      without Sam.
488,The Two Towers,SAM,"Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun. I was being serious."
489,The Two Towers,FRODO,"So was l. ,"
490,The Two Towers,SAM,"""Samwise the Brave."""
491,The Two Towers,FRODO,Smeagol?
492,The Two Towers,SAM,"We're not going to wait for you. Come on.,"
493,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,"Master. Master looks after us. ,Master wouldn't hurt us."
494,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Master broke his promise.
495,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,"Don't ask Smeagol. Poor, poor Smeagol."
496,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"Master betrayed us. Wicked. Tricksy. False. ,We ought to wring his filthy little neck.,Kill him! Kill him! Kill them both! ,And then we take the precious......and we be the master!"
497,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,You know nothing of this matter!
498,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,He would have kept it for his own.  And when he returned you would not     have known your son.
499,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,Boromir was loyal to me!   Not some wizard's pupil.
500,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,Father?
501,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"My son!  ,  Leave me!"
502,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,Careful master!  Careful.   Very far to fall.  Very dangerous are the     stairs.
503,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,Come master.
504,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,Come to Smeagol.
505,The Return of the King,SAM,"Mr Frodo!  , Get back     you!  Don't touch him."
506,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Why does he hates poor Smeagol?  What has Smeagol ever done to him?      Master?  ,Master carries a heavy     burden Smeagol knows, heavy heavy burden.  Fat one cannot know.  ,  He wants it.  He needs     it.  Smeagol sees it in his eye.  , Very soon he will ask you for it.  You     will see.   The fat one will take it from you!"
507,The Return of the King,WITCH KING,Send forth all legions.  Do not stop the attack until the city is     taken.
508,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,"But the fat Hobbit, he knows.      Eyes always watching."
509,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Then we stabs them out. Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
510,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,Yes. Yes. Yes.
511,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Kill them both.
512,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,"Yes. , No! No! ,It's too risky. It's too risky."
513,The Two Towers,SAM,"Where is he? Where has he gone? Hey, Gollum! Where are you?"
514,The Two Towers,FRODO,Smeagol?
515,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"We could let , do it."
516,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,Yes. She could do it.
517,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"Yes, precious, she could. And then we takes it once they're dead."
518,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,"Once they're dead. ,Ssssssssssssssh!"
519,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,"Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet. , Smeagol will show you the way."
520,The Two Towers,EOMER,Stay out of the forest! Keep away from the trees!
521,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,Final count.....42.
522,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"Forty-two? That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling. I myself am sitting pretty on 43.,"
523,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,Forty-three.
524,The Two Towers,GIMLI,He was already dead.
525,The Return of the King,WITCH KING,Slay them all!
526,The Return of the King,GOTHMOG,What of the wizard?
527,The Return of the King,WITCH KING,I will break him.
528,The Return of the King,SOLDIER 1,Where are Theoden's riders?
529,The Return of the King,SOLDIER 2,Will Rohan's army come?  Mithrandir?
530,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Courage is the best defence that you have now.
531,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Follow me.
532,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,He was twitching.
533,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"He was twitching......because he's got my axe ,embedded in his nervous system!"
534,The Two Towers,MERRY,"He doesn't look too happy, does he?"
535,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"Not too happy at all, Merry."
536,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there."
537,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment. I hear the staff are very good."
538,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,What are you doing?
539,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Nothing. The world's back to normal, that's all."
540,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"No, it isn't. I'm starving."
541,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Good luck trying to find something decent around here. ,Probably only dead rats and      mouldy bread.,"
542,The Two Towers,MERRY,Saruman's storeroom!
543,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,I don't believe it.
544,The Two Towers,MERRY,It can't be.
545,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,lt is!
546,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Longbottom Leaf. ,The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing."
547,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"It's perfect. One barrel each.,Wait.      Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?"
548,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Share it? ,No. No. ,Dead plant and all that. Don't think he'd understand. ,Could be a distant relative."
549,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,I get it. Don't be hasty.
550,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Exactly.      , Bar-hrum."
551,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,This is the old sewer. Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.      You'll find cover in the woods there.
552,The Two Towers,SAM,"Captain Faramir......you have shown your quality, sir."
553,The Two Towers,SAM,The very highest.
554,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,The Shire must truly be a great realm      Master Gamgee......where gardeners are held in high honor.
555,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,What road will you take once you reach the woods?
556,The Two Towers,FRODO,"Gollum says there's a path......near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.,"
557,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"Cirith Ungol?,"
558,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,ls that its name?
559,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"No. ,No! , Yes."
560,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,Frodo......they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas      Morgul. You cannot go that way.
561,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"lt is the only way. Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try."
562,The Two Towers,FRODO,I must.
563,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"Go, Frodo. Go with the goodwill of all Men.,"
564,The Two Towers,FRODO,Thank you.
565,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
566,The Two Towers,SAM,"Come on, keep up."
567,The Two Towers,SAM,"Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you. You know that, don't you?      He was trying to save you, see?"
568,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Save me?
569,The Two Towers,SAM,So there's no hard feelings. Forgive and forget.
570,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"No, no, no hard feelings. Gollum, Gollum. ,Yes, master. Nice Hobbits."
571,The Two Towers,SAM,"Very decent of you. Very decent, indeed      Gollum."
572,The Two Towers,MADRIL,Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern shore. Their numbers are too great.      By nightfall we will be overrun.
573,The Two Towers,SAM,Mr. Frodo?
574,The Two Towers,FRODO,"It's calling to him, Sam. His Eye is almost on me."
575,The Two Towers,SAM,"Hold on, Mr. Frodo. You'll be all right."
576,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"Take them to my father. ,Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.      ,A weapon that will change our fortunes      in this war. ,"
577,The Two Towers,SAM,"Do you want to know      what happened to Boromir? ,You want to know why your brother died?  He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him! ,He tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad!"
578,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Watch out!
579,The Two Towers,SAM,Mr. Frodo?
580,The Two Towers,FRODO,They're here.
581,The Two Towers,FRODO,They've come.
582,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,Nazgul!
583,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"Stay here. Keep out of sight. ,Take cover!"
584,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"The fortress is taken. It is over.,"
585,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.      They still defend it. They have died defending it.
586,The Two Towers,WOMAN,They are breaking in!
587,The Two Towers,WOMAN,They're past the door!
588,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Is there no other way for the women      and children to get out of the caves?
589,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Is there no other way?
590,The Two Towers,GAMLING,There is one passage. It leads into the mountains. But they will not get far.      The Uruk-hai are too many.
591,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Tell the women and children      to make for the mountain pass. And barricade the entrance!
592,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get your men out of there!,"
593,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Nan Barad! Nan Barad! , Haldir, nan Barad! ("
594,The Two Towers,GIMLI,What are you doing? What are you stopping for?
595,The Two Towers,HALDIR,Nan Barad! (To the Keep!)
596,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Haldir!
597,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"So much death. ,  What can Men do against such reckless hate?"
598,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Ride out with me. ,Ride out and meet them.,"
599,The Two Towers,THEODEN,For death and glory.
600,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,For Rohan. For your people.
601,The Two Towers,GIMLI,The sun is rising.
602,The Two Towers,GANDALF VOICEOVER,Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn......Iook to the east.
603,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Yes.........Yes.........The horn of Helm Hammerhand......shall sound in the Deep......one last time.
604,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"Yes!,"
605,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"Let this be the hour      when we draw swords together. ,"
606,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"Fell deeds, awake. Now for wrath......now for ruin and a red dawn.,"
607,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"Forth Eorlingas!,"
608,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Gandalf.
609,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"Theoden King stands alone.,"
610,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Brace the gate!
611,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Hold them!
612,The Two Towers,THEODEN,To the gate. Draw your swords!
613,The Two Towers,GAMLING,"Make way! ( ,We cannot hold much longer!"
614,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Hold them!
615,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,How long do you need?
616,The Two Towers,THEODEN,As long as you can give me.
617,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Gimli!
618,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Timbers! Brace the gate!
619,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Come on. We can take them.
620,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,It's a long way.
621,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Toss me.
622,The Two Towers,EOMER,"Not alone. , Rohirrim!"
623,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"Eomer.,"
624,The Two Towers,EOMER,To the king!
625,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Yes!
626,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,A hit. A fine hit.
627,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,Break the dam!  Release the river!
628,The Two Towers,MERRY,Pippin! Hold on!
629,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"Hold on, little Hobbits."
630,The Two Towers,SAM,What are you doing?
631,The Two Towers,SAM,Where are you going?
632,The Two Towers,SAM,It's me. It's your Sam. Don't you know your Sam?
633,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,What?
634,The Two Towers,GIMLI,I cannot jump the distance! You'll have to toss me!
635,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Don't tell the Elf.
636,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Not a word.
637,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Shore up the door!
638,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Make way!
639,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Follow me to the barricade.
640,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Watch our backs!
641,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Throw another one over here!
642,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Higher!
643,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Hold fast the gate!
644,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!
645,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,Aragorn!
646,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Pull everybody back. Pull them back.
647,The Two Towers,GAMLING,Fall back! Fall back!
648,The Two Towers,FRODO,"I can't do this, Sam."
649,The Two Towers,SAM,"I know. It's all wrong.      ,By rights, we shouldn't even be here.      But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered.      ,Full of darkness and danger they were.      And sometimes you didn't want to know the end.....because how could the end be happy?       How could the world go back      to the way it was...... when so much bad had happened?"
650,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Victory! We have victory!
651,The Two Towers,SAM VOICEOVER,"But in the end, it's only a passing thing...... this shadow. Even darkness must pass.      A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.      Those were the stories      that stayed with you......that meant something. Even if you were too small      to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now."
652,The Two Towers,SAM,"Folk in those stories......had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.      They kept going......because they were holding on to something."
653,The Two Towers,FRODO,"What are we holding on to, Sam?"
654,The Two Towers,SAM,"That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it's worth fighting for."
655,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins. ,"
656,The Two Towers,MADRIL,"You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father. If you let them go      your life will be forfeit."
657,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"Then it is forfeit. Release them.,"
658,The Two Towers,THEODEN,They have broken through! The castle is breached. Retreat!
659,The Two Towers,GAMLING,Fall back!
660,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Retreat!
661,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!
662,The Two Towers,GAMLING,Into the Keep!
663,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,I will leave you at the western borders of the forest. You can make your way north      to your homeland from there.
664,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Wait! Stop! Stop! Turn around. Turn around. Take us south.
665,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,South? But that will lead you past lsengard.
666,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"Yes. Exactly.,If we go south, we can slip      past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.      It's the last thing he'll expect."
667,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"That doesn't make sense to me.      But then......you are very small. ,Perhaps you're right. South it is, then.      Hold on, little Shirelings. ,I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going downhill.,"
668,The Two Towers,MERRY,Are you mad? We'll be caught.
669,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"No, we won't. Not this time."
670,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Look! Osgiliath burns!
671,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Mordor has come.
672,The Two Towers,FRODO,"The Ring will not save Gondor.      , It has only the power to destroy.      Please......Iet me go."
673,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,Hurry.
674,The Two Towers,FRODO,Faramir! You must let me go!
675,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"And those little family of field mice......that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully."
676,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,They're always trying to get somewhere where they....
677,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,Many of these trees were my friends. Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
678,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"I'm sorry, Treebeard."
679,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,They had voices of their own.
680,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,Saruman. A wizard should know better!
681,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,There is no curse in Elvish......Entish or the tongues of Men......for this treachery.
682,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"You could have picked a better spot.,"
683,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night."
684,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,"Your friends are with you, Aragorn."
685,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Let's hope they last the night.
686,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"A      Eruch'n, '-dano i faelas a hyn an uben tanatha le faelas! ,"
687,The Two Towers,GIMLI,What's happening out there?
688,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,Shall I describe it to you? Or would you like me to find you a box?
689,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Look! The trees! They're moving!
690,The Two Towers,MERRY,Where are they going?
691,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,They have business with the Orcs. My business is with lsengard tonight......with rock and stone.
692,The Two Towers,MERRY,Yes!
693,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"Come, my friends. The Ents are going to war. It is likely......that we go to our doom.      Last march......of the Ents."
694,The Two Towers,THEODEN,So it begins.
695,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Tangado a chadad!
696,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,Faeg i-varv d'n na lanc a      nu ranc.
697,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Leithio i philinn!
698,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"Did they hit anything?,"
699,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Give them a volley.
700,The Two Towers,GAMLING,Fire!
701,The Two Towers,OLD MAN,Fire!
702,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Ribed bant!
703,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"Send them to me! Come on!,"
704,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Pendraith! ,"
705,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Good!
706,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Swords! Swords!
707,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Legolas! Two already!
708,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,I'm on 17!
709,The Two Towers,GIMLI,I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
710,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,Nineteen!
711,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Merry.
712,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"We have just agreed.,"
713,The Two Towers,MERRY,Yes?
714,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"I have told your names to the Entmoot......and we have agreed......you are not      Orcs.,"
715,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"Well, that's good news."
716,The Two Towers,MERRY,And what about Saruman? Have you come to a decision about him?
717,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc."
718,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Hasty? Our friends are out there. ,They need our help. They cannot fight this war on their own."
719,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"War? Yes. It affects us all. Tree, root and twig.      But you must understand, young Hobbit......it takes a long time......to say anything in Old      Entish... ,...and we never say anything......unless it is worth taking......a long time to say.,"
720,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty! Twenty-one!
721,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Causeway!
722,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Is this it? Is this is all you can conjure      Saruman?
723,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Togo hon dad, Legolas! ,"
724,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Dago hon! Dago hon!
725,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Brace the gate!
726,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Hold them! Stand firm!
727,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Aragorn!
728,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Gimli!
729,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Hado i philinn!
730,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Herio!
731,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"The Ents cannot hold back this storm. We must weather such things as we have always done.,"
732,The Two Towers,MERRY,How can that be your decision?!
733,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"This is not our war.,"
734,The Two Towers,MERRY,"But you're part of this world!      Aren't you?!,"
735,The Two Towers,MERRY,You must help. Please. You must do something.
736,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"You are young and brave, Master Merry. But your part in this tale is over.      Go back to your home.,"
737,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"Maybe Treebeard's right. We don't belong here, Merry. It's too big for us.      What can we do in the end? We've got the Shire. Maybe we should go home.,"
738,The Two Towers,MERRY,"The fires of lsengard will spread......and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.      And.... ,And all that was once green and good      in this world will be gone. There won't be a Shire, Pippin."
739,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Boromir! Boromir!
740,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,"This city was once the jewel of our kingdom. A place of light and beauty     and music. And so it shall be once more! ,Let the armies of Mordor know this:     Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.    ,This city of Osgiliath has been     reclaimed ,for     Gondor!"
741,The Two Towers,CROWD,For Gondor!
742,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,For Gondor!
743,The Two Towers,CROWD,For Gondor!
744,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,For Gondor!
745,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,Good speech. Nice and short.
746,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,Leaves more time for drinking!     Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!
747,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,"Remember today, little brother. Today, life is good."
748,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,What?
749,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,He's here.
750,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,"One moment of peace, can he not give us that?"
751,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,Where is he? Where is Gondor's finest? Where's my first-born?
752,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,Father!
753,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
754,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,They exaggerate. The victory belongs to Faramir also.
755,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,"But for Faramir, this city would still be standing."
756,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,Were you not entrusted to protect it?
757,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"I would have done, but our numbers were too few."
758,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,"Oh, too few. You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim. Always you     cast a poor reflection on me."
759,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,That is not my intent.
760,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,"You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will."
761,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,"He loves you, Father."
762,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,"Do not trouble me with Faramir......I know his uses, and they are few.     We have more urgent things to speak of. Elrond of Rivendell has called a     meeting. He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose. It is rumored     that the weapon of the enemy has been found."
763,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,The One Ring. lsildur's     Bane.
764,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,"lt has fallen into the hands of     the Elves. Everyone will try to claim it: Men, Dwarves, wizards. We cannot     let that happen. This thing must come to Gondor."
765,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,Gondor.
766,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,"It's dangerous,     I know. Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men. But     you, you are strong.    And our need is great. It is our blood which is being spilled, our people     who are dying. Sauron is biding his time. He's massing fresh armies. He will     return. And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him. You must go.    ,Bring me back this     mighty gift    ."
767,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,"No. My place is here with     my people. ,Not in Rivendell."
768,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,Would you deny your own father?
769,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,lf there is need to go to Rivendell......send me in his stead.
770,The Two Towers,DENETHOR,"You? Oh, I see. A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his     quality. I think not. ,I trust this mission only to your brother. The one who will not     fail me."
771,The Two Towers,BOROMIR,"Remember today, little brother."
772,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,"Captain Faramir! ,We     found the third one."
773,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,You must come with me. Now.
774,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,Down there.
775,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.    ,They wait for my command. Shall I     shoot?"
776,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,The rock and pool    Is nice and cool    So juicy sweet    Our only wish    To catch a fish    So juicy sweet
777,The Two Towers,FRODO,Wait. This creature is bound to me. And I to him. He is our guide.     Please......Iet me go down to him.
778,The Two Towers,FRODO,"Smeagol. , Master is here.     Come, Smeagol. Trust master. Come."
779,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,We must go now?
780,The Two Towers,FRODO,"Smeagol, you must trust master. Follow me. Come on. Come. Come, Smeagol.     Nice Smeagol. That's it. Come on."
781,The Two Towers,FRODO,"Don't hurt him! ,Smeagol, don't struggle. Smeagol, listen     to me."
782,The Two Towers,ARWEN,May the grace of the Valarprotect you.

785,The Two Towers,ARWEN,I have made my choice.
786,The Two Towers,ELROND,He is not coming back.Why do you linger herewhen there is no hope?
787,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Master!
788,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"That's enough. ,Where     are you leading them? ,Answer me."
789,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"Smeagol. Why does it cry, Smeagol?"
790,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,Cruel Men hurts us. Master     tricksed us.
791,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Of course he did. I told you he was tricksy. I told you he was false.
792,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,Master is our friend. Our friend.
793,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Master betrayed us.
794,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,No. Not its business. Leave us alone!
795,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Filthy little     Hobbitses! They stole it from us!
796,The Two Towers,ARWEN,There is still hope.
797,The Two Towers,ELROND,If Aragorn survives this waryou will still be parted.If Sauron is defeatedand Aragorn made king......and all that you hope forcomes true......you will still have to tastethe bitterness of mortality.
798,The Two Towers,ELROND VOICEOVER,Whether by the swordor the slow decay of time......Aragorn will die.And there will be no comfortfor you......no comfort to ease the painof his passing.He will come to death......an image of the splendorof the kings of Men......in glory undimmed beforethe breaking of the world.
799,The Two Towers,ELROND VOICEOVER,"But you, my daughter......you will linger on in darknessand in doubt......as nightfall in winterthat comes without a star.Here you will dwell......bound to your griefunder the fading trees...... until all the world is changed......and the long years of your lifeare utterly spent."
800,The Two Towers,ELROND,"Arwen.,There is nothing for you here......only death."

804,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,What news?
805,The Two Towers,MADRIL,"Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan. , Theoden's people have fled     to Helm's Deep. But we must look to our own borders. Faramir, Orcs are on     the move. Sauron is marshaling an army. Easterlings and Southrons are at the     Black Gate."
806,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,How many?
807,The Two Towers,MADRIL,Some thousands. More come every day.
808,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,Who's covering the river to the north?
809,The Two Towers,MADRIL,"We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath. If their city is attacked, we won't hold     it."
810,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,No. No.
811,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,What did they steal?
812,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,My precious!
813,The Two Towers,SAM,"We have to get out of here.     You go. Go, now. You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put     it on. Disappear."
814,The Two Towers,FRODO,"I can't. You were right, Sam. You tried to tell me but....,I'm sorry. The Ring's taking me, Sam. If I put it     on......he'll find me. He'll see."
815,The Two Towers,SAM,Mr.     Frodo....
816,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"So this is the answer to all the riddles. ,Here in the     Wild I have you......two Halflings......and a host of men at my call.,The Ring of Power within my     grasp.,A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor......to     show his quality."
817,The Two Towers,FRODO,No!
818,The Two Towers,SAM,"Stop it! Leave him alone. ,Don't you understand? He's got to destroy     it! That's where we're going, into Mordor. To the Mountain of Fire!"
819,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Osgiliath is under attack. They call for reinforcements.
820,The Two Towers,SAM,Please. It's such a burden.     Will you not help him?
821,The Two Towers,SOLDIER,Captain?
822,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"Prepare to leave.    ,The Ring will go to Gondor."
823,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Mae carnen, Brego,     mellon n'n."
824,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,Saruman attacks from lsengard. Sauron from Mordor. The fight will come to     Men on both fronts. Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us soon. And he will     strike hard. He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
825,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
826,The Two Towers,SAM,Spies? Now wait just a minute.
827,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?"
828,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,Speak.
829,The Two Towers,FRODO,"We are Hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is     Samwise Gamgee."
830,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,Your bodyguard?
831,The Two Towers,SAM,His gardener.
832,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,And where is your skulking friend? That gangrel creature. He had an ill-favored     look.
833,The Two Towers,FRODO,"There was no other.    ,We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in Moria......two     were my kin......a Dwarf there was also. And an Elf and two Men. Aragorn,     son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor."
834,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,You're a friend of Boromir?
835,The Two Towers,FRODO,Yes.  For my part.
836,The Two Towers,WOMAN,He's alive!
837,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"Where is he? Where is he?,Get out of the     way! I'm going to kill him!,You are the luckiest, the canniest    ,.....and the most reckless man     I ever knew. Bless you, laddie."
838,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Gimli, where is the king?"
839,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,"Le abdollen. ,You look terrible."
840,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Hannon le.
841,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"A great host, you say?"
842,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,All lsengard is emptied.
843,The Two Towers,THEODEN,How many?
844,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Ten thousand strong at least.
845,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Ten thousand?
846,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,It is an army bred for a single purpose: To destroy the world of Men.     They will be here by nightfall.
847,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Let them come!
848,The Two Towers,THEODEN,I want every man and strong     lad able to bear arms......to be ready for battle by nightfall.
849,The Two Towers,THEODEN,We will cover the causeway and the gate from above. No army has ever     breached the Deeping Wall......or set foot inside the Hornburg!
850,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,It will grieve you then to     learn that he is dead.
851,The Two Towers,FRODO,Dead? How? When?
852,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me."
853,The Two Towers,FRODO,"If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us."
854,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past. It was     cloven in two. But more than this, I know it in my heart.    ,He was my brother."
855,The Two Towers,GIMLI,This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. These are Uruk-hai. Their armour is     thick and their shields broad.
856,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. I know how to defend my own keep."
857,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.    ,Saruman's     hordes will pillage and burn.    We've seen it before. Crops can be resown......homes rebuilt. Within these     walls......we will outlast them."
858,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages. They come to     destroy its people......down to the last child.
859,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a     thread. If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an     end......as to be worthy of remembrance."
860,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Send out riders, my lord. You must call for aid."
861,The Two Towers,THEODEN,And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We are not so lucky in our friends as     you. The old alliances are dead.
862,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Gondor will answer.
863,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"(    Gondor?! Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?! Where was Gondor when our     enemies closed in around us?! Where was Gon--? ,No, my Lord     Aragorn......we are alone. ,Get the women and children     into the caves."
864,The Two Towers,GAMLING,We need more time to lay provisions--
865,The Two Towers,ARWEN VOICEOVER,The light of the Evenstardoes not wax and wane.It is mine to give to whom I will.Like my heart.Go to sleep.
866,The Two Towers,ARAGORN ,"I am asleep.,This is a dream."
867,The Two Towers,ARWEN,"Then it is a good dream. ,Sleep."

872,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,Master's my friend.
873,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,You don't have any friends.Nobody likes you.
874,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,Not listening. I'm not listening.
875,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,You're a liar and a thief.
876,The Two Towers,SMEAGOL,No.
877,The Two Towers,THEODEN,There is no time. War is upon us. Secure the gate.
878,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"We Ents have not troubled......about the wars of Men and     wizards......for a very long time. But now, something is about to     happen......that has not happened......for an age.,Entmoot."
879,The Two Towers,MERRY,What's that?
880,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,'Tis a gathering.
881,The Two Towers,MERRY,A     gathering of what?
882,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"Beech. Oak. Chestnut. Ash. Good. Good. Good. Many have come.,Now we must decide if the Ents......will     go to war."

949,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"What do you fear, my lady?"
950,The Two Towers,EOWYN,A cage.To stay behind bars until useand old age accept them.And all chance of valor has gonebeyond recall or desire.
951,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,You're a daughter of kings......a shieldmaiden of Rohan.I do not think that would be your fate.

983,The Two Towers,SAM,Wait! We're innocent travelers!
984,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,There are no travelers in this land.Only servants of the Dark Tower.
985,The Two Towers,FRODO,We are bound to an errand of secrecy.Those that claim to oppose the enemywould do well not to hinder us.
986,The Two Towers,FARAMIR,"The enemy? ,His sense of duty was no lessthan yours, I deem.,You wonder what his name is......where he came from.,And if he was really evil at heart.,What lies or threats led himon this long march from home.,If he would not rather have stayed there......in peace.,War will make corpses of us all.,Bind their hands."
987,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"It's true, you don't seemany Dwarf women.And in fact, they are so alikein voice and appearance......that they're often mistakenfor Dwarf men."
988,The Two Towers,FRODO,Because I have to believehe can come back.
989,The Two Towers,SAM,"You can't save him, Mr. Frodo."
990,The Two Towers,FRODO,"What do you know about it?Nothing! ,I'm sorry, Sam. I don't knowwhy I said that."
991,The Two Towers,SAM,"I do. ,It's the Ring.You can't take your eyes off it.I've seen you.You're not eating. You barely sleep. ,It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo. You have to fight it."
992,The Two Towers,FRODO,"I know what I have to do, Sam.The Ring was entrusted to me.It's my task.Mine! My own!"
993,The Two Towers,SAM,Can't you hear yourself?Don't you know who you sound like?

1017,The Return of the King,SAM,"It's gone Mr Frodo. The light's passed on, away towards the North.     Something's drawn its gaze."
1018,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Hold your ground! Hold your ground!
1019,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers. (They listen to him.) I see it in     your eyes, the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come     when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all     bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day! An hour of wolves and shattered     shields when the age of men comes crashing down, but it is not this day!     This day we fight!"
1020,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand! Men of the     West!"
1021,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an elf.
1022,The Two Towers,GANDALF,The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.Sauron will suffer no rival.From the summit of Barad-durhis Eye watches ceaselessly.But he is not so mighty yetthat he is above fear.Doubt ever gnaws at him.The rumor has reached him.The heir of Numenor still lives.
1023,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,It's the beards.
1024,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"This, in turn, has given riseto the belief......that there are no Dwarf women......and that Dwarves just spring outof holes in the ground..."
1025,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"...which is, of course, ridiculous."
1026,The Two Towers,GIMLI,It's all right. Nobody panic.That was deliberate.It was deliberate.
1027,The Two Towers,THEODEN,I haven't seen my niece smilefor a long time.She was a girl when they broughther father back dead.Cut down by Orcs.She watched her mothersuccumb to grief.
1028,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Then she was left aloneto tend her king in growing fear.Doomed to wait upon an old manwho should have loved her as a father.
1029,The Two Towers,EOWYN,Gimli.?
1030,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"No, I couldn'tI really couldn't."
1031,The Two Towers,GAMLING,Make way for the king.Make way for Theoden.Make way for the king.
1032,The Two Towers,EOWYN,So few. So few of you have returned.
1033,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Our people are safe.We have paid for it with many lives.
1034,The Two Towers,GIMLI,My lady.
1035,The Two Towers,EOWYN,Lord Aragorn......where is he?
1036,The Two Towers,GIMLI,He fell.
1037,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Draw all our forces behind the wall.Bar the gate.And set a watch on the surround.
1038,The Two Towers,GAMLING,"What of those who cannot fight, my lord?The women and children?"
1039,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"Get them into the caves. , Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can     reach us here."
1040,The Two Towers,GRIMA,Helm's Deep has one weakness.Its outer wall is solid rock......but for a small culvertat its base...... which is little more than a drain.
1041,The Two Towers,GRIMA,How? How can fire undo stone?
1042,The Two Towers,EOWYN,Sssh
1043,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.    ,All     the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet     him head on. Draw him away from your women and children.    , You must     fight."
1044,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak. Eomer is loyal to you.     His men will return and fight for their king.
1045,The Two Towers,THEODEN,They will be 300     leagues from here by now. Eomer cannot help us. I know what it is you want     of me......but I will not bring further death to my people. I will not risk     open war.
1046,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not."
1047,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"When last I looked......Theoden, not Aragorn, was King of Rohan."
1048,The Two Towers,HAMA,By order of the king......the city must empty. We make for the refuge of     Helm's Deep.
1049,The Two Towers,HAMA,Do not burden yourself with treasures. Take only what provisions you     need.
1050,The Two Towers,GANDALF,Helm's Deep.
1051,The Two Towers,GIMLI,They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. Who will     defend them if not their king?
1052,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helm's Deep has     saved them in the past.
1053,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"There is no way out of that ravine. Theoden is walking into a trap. He     thinks he's leading them to safety. What they will get is a massacre.     Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of     Rohan. , He will need     you before the end,    Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. ,The defenses , to hold."
1054,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,"What about side by side with a friend? ,"
1055,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Aye! I could do that.
1056,The Return of the King,SAM,"Do you remember the Shire Mr Frodo? It will be Spring soon and the orchards     will be in blossom. And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thickets. (He     is crying.) And they will be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields,     (Frodo opens his eyes and looks at him.) and eating the first of the     strawberries and cream. Do you remember the taste of strawberries?"
1057,The Return of the King,FRODO,"No Sam. I can't recall the taste of food, nor the sound of water or the     touch of grass. I'm naked in the dark. There's' there's nothing, no veil     between me and the wheel of fire. ,I can see him with my waking eyes!"
1058,The Return of the King,SAM,"Then let us be rid of it once and for all! Come on Mr Frodo, I can't carry     it for you, but I can carry you! Come on!"
1059,The Return of the King,EYE OF SAURON,"Aragorn! ,     Elessar!"
1060,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,For Frodo.
1061,The Return of the King,SAM,"Look Mr Frodo, a doorway! We're almost there!"
1062,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Clever Hobbits to climb so high! ,Mustn't go that way. Mustn't hurt the     precious!"
1063,The Return of the King,FRODO,You swore! You swore on the precious!
1064,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"Sauron fears you, Aragorn.He fears what you may become.And so he'll strike hard and fastat the world of Men.He will use his puppet Sarumanto destroy Rohan.War is coming.Rohan must defend itselfand therein lies our first challenge......for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.    ,The king's mind is enslavedit's an old device of Saruman's.His hold over King Theodenis now very strong.Sauron and Sarumanare tightening the noose.But for all their cunning......we have one advantage. The Ring remains hidden.And that we should seek to destroy it......has not yet enteredtheir darkest dreams. And so the weapon of the enemyis moving towards Mordor......in the hands of a Hobbit.Each day brings it closerto the fires of Mount Doom. We must trust now in Frodo.Everything depends upon speed......and the secrecy of his quest."
1065,The Two Towers,GANDALF,Do not regret your decision to leave him.Frodo must finish this task alone.
1066,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,He's not alone.Sam went with him.
1067,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"Did he?Did he, indeed? Good. Yes, very good."
1068,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,The Black Gate of Mordor.
1069,The Two Towers,SAM,"Oh, save us.My old Gaffer would have a thing or twoto say if he could see us now."
1070,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Master says to show himthe way into Mordor.So good Smeagol doesmaster says so.
1071,The Two Towers,FRODO,I did.
1072,The Two Towers,SAM,"That's it, then.We can't get past that."
1073,The Two Towers,SAM,Look!The gate.It's opening!I can see a way down.
1074,The Two Towers,FRODO,"Sam, no!"
1075,The Two Towers,EOWYN,"I made some stew.It isn't much, but it's hot."
1076,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Thank you. ,It's good."
1077,The Two Towers,EOWYN,Really?
1078,The Two Towers,EOWYN,"My uncle told me a strange thing.He said that you rode to warwith Thengel, my grandfather.But he must be mistaken."
1079,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,King Theoden has a good memory.He was only a small child at the time.
1080,The Two Towers,EOWYN,Then you must be at least 60.
1081,The Two Towers,EOWYN,Seventy?But you cannot be 80!
1082,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Eighty-seven.
1083,The Two Towers,EOWYN,You are one of the Dunedain.A descendant of Numenorblessed with long life.It was said that your racehad passed into legend.
1084,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,There are few of us left.The Northern Kingdomwas destroyed long ago.
1085,The Two Towers,EOWYN,"I'm sorry. Please, eat."
1086,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Did we lose him? I think we lost him.
1087,The Two Towers,ORC,I'm going to rip outyour filthy little innards!
1088,The Two Towers,ORC,Come here!
1089,The Two Towers,MERRY,Trees. Climb a tree.
1090,The Two Towers,GRIMA,What kind of devicecould bring down the wall?
1091,The Two Towers,SARUMAN,If the wall is breachedHelm's Deep will fall.
1092,The Two Towers,GRIMA,"Even if it is breached, it would takea number beyond reckoning......thousands, to storm the Keep."
1093,The Two Towers,SARUMAN,Tens of thousands.
1094,The Two Towers,GRIMA,"But, my lord, there is no such force."
1095,The Two Towers,SARUMAN,A new power is rising.Its victory is at hand.
1096,The Two Towers,SARUMAN,This night......the land will be stainedwith the blood of Rohan!March to Helm's Deep!Leave none alive!
1097,The Two Towers,SARUMAN,To war!
1098,The Two Towers,SARUMAN,There will be no dawn for Men.
1099,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Look. There's smoke to the south.
1100,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,There is always smoke rising......from lsengard these days.
1101,The Two Towers,MERRY,Isengard?
1102,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,There was a time......when Saruman would walk in my woods.But now he has a mind of metal......and wheels.He no longer cares for growing things.
1103,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,What is it?
1104,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,The eagles! The eagles are coming!
1105,The Return of the King,SAM,Frodo!
1106,The Return of the King,FRODO,I'm here Sam!
1107,The Return of the King,SAM,Destroy it!
1108,The Return of the King,SAM,Go on! Now! Throw it in the fire!
1109,The Return of the King,SAM,What are you waiting for? Just let it go!
1110,The Return of the King,FRODO,The Ring is mine!
1111,The Return of the King,SAM,No!
1112,The Return of the King,SAM,Nooooooo!
1113,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Yeees! , Yeees!    , Precious! My Precious!"
1114,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,They will hold.
1115,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"The Grey Pilgrim.     That's what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of Men I've walked     this earth, and now I have no time. With luck, my search will not be in     vain. ,Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to     the east."
1116,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Go.
1117,The Two Towers,ROHAN STABLEMAN,"That horse is half mad, my lord. There's nothing you can do. Leave him."
1118,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"F'ste, stille n',     f'ste, stille n'. Lac is drefed, gefr'gon."
1119,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Hw't nemna' 'e? Hm? Hw't nemna' 'e? (
1120,The Two Towers,EOWYN,His name is Brego. He     was my cousin's horse.
1121,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Brego. 'in nama is cynglic. (,)"
1122,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"Man le trasta, Brego? Man cenich? (,)"
1123,The Two Towers,EOWYN,I have heard of the magic of Elves......but I did not look for it in a     Ranger from the North.You speak as one of their own.
1124,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,I was raised in Rivendell......for a time.Turn this fellow free. He's     seen enough of war.
1125,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,"Fifteen, sixteen."
1126,The Return of the King,EOWYN,Merry!
1127,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Legolas!
1128,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,"Thirty three, thirty four."
1129,The Return of the King,GIMLI,That still only counts as one!
1130,The Return of the King,ORC,"Come on then , come on!"
1131,The Return of the King,THEODEN,"I know your face, Eowyn. ,  My eyes darken."
1132,The Return of the King,EOWYN,"No, no.  I'm going to save you."
1133,The Return of the King,THEODEN,"You already did.  Eowyn, my body is broken.  You have to let me go."
1134,The Return of the King,FRODO,Smeagol promised!
1135,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,Smeagol lied!
1136,The Return of the King,SAM,AAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhhhh!
1137,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,AAAAAHH
1138,The Return of the King,SAM,", Frodo!"
1139,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Master!
1140,The Two Towers,FRODO,"I do not ask you to come with me, Sam."
1141,The Two Towers,SAM,"I know, Mr. Frodo.I doubt even these Elvish cloakswill hide us in there."
1142,The Two Towers,FRODO,Now!
1143,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"No!No! No, master!They catch you! They catch you!Don't take it to him.He wants the precious.Always he is looking for it.And the precious is wantingto go back to him.But we mustn't let him have it."
1144,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"No! , There's another way.More secret. A dark way."
1145,The Two Towers,SAM,Why haven't you spoken of this before?
1146,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Because master did not ask.
1147,The Two Towers,SAM,He's up to something.
1148,The Two Towers,FRODO,Are you saying there's another wayinto Mordor?
1149,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Yes. There's a path......and some stairs.And then......a tunnel.
1150,The Two Towers,FRODO,"He's led us this far, Sam."
1151,The Two Towers,SAM,"Mr. Frodo, no."
1152,The Two Towers,FRODO,He's been true to his word.
1153,The Two Towers,SAM,No.
1154,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Merry!
1155,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"Merry! ,  Merry it's me.    ,  It's Pippin!"
1156,The Return of the King,MERRY,I knew you'd find me.
1157,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Yes.
1158,The Return of the King,MERRY,Are you going to leave me?
1159,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"No Merry, I'm going to look after you."
1160,The Return of the King,GORBAG,"Hands off! That shiny shirt, that's mine!"
1161,The Two Towers,ARGORN,Their pace has quickened.They must have caught our scent.Hurry!
1162,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,"Come on, Gimli!"
1163,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Three days and nights pursuit.No food. No rest.And no sign of our quarrybut what bare rock can tell.
1164,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
1165,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,They may yet be alive.
1166,The Two Towers,ARGORN,Less than a day ahead of us. Come.
1167,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,"Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!"
1168,The Two Towers,GIMLI,I'm wasted on cross-country.We Dwarves are natural sprinters.Very dangerous over short distances.
1169,The Two Towers,MERRY,He's gone.
1170,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Merry!
1171,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,Hooom!
1172,The Two Towers,MERRY,Aaagh!

1174,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"Run, Merry!"
1175,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,Little Orcs.
1176,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"It's talking, Merry.The tree is talking."
1177,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,Tree?I am no tree!I am an Ent.
1178,The Two Towers,MERRY,A tree-herder.A shepherd of the forest.
1179,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"Don't talk to it, Merry.Don't encourage it!"
1180,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"Treebeard, some call me."
1181,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,And whose side are you on?
1182,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,Side?I am on nobody's side......because nobody's on my sidelittle Orc.Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
1183,The Two Towers,MERRY,We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!
1184,The Two Towers,GANDALF VOICE OVER,You cannot pass!
1185,The Two Towers,FRODO VOICE OVER,Gandalf!
1186,The Two Towers,GANDALF VOICE OVER,"I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.    Go back to the Shadow.The dark fire will not avail you,flame of Udun!"
1187,The Two Towers,GANDALF,You shall not pass!
1188,The Two Towers,BOROMIR ,No! No!
1189,The Two Towers,FRODO,Gandalf!
1190,The Two Towers,MERRY,It's Saruman's army.The war has started.

1197,The Return of the King,SAM,Yes Mr Frodo. It's over now.
1198,The Return of the King,FRODO,I can see the Shire. The Brandywine River. Bag End. Gandalf's fireworks. The     lights on the party tree.
1199,The Return of the King,SAM,"Rosie Cotton dancing. ,     She had ribbons in her hair. If ever I was to marry someone, it would have     been her. , It would've been her."
1200,The Return of the King,FRODO,I'm glad to be with you Samwise Gamgee here at the end of all things.     They hug.
1201,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"I am steward of the house of An'rion. Thus have I walked, and thus now I will sleep."
1202,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"Gondor is lost. There is no hope for men. , Why do the fools fly? Better to die sooner than late. For die we must."
1203,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long slow sleep of death embalmed. We shall burn like the heathen Kings of old. , Bring wood and oil."
1204,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Steady! Steady!
1205,The Return of the King,GANDALF,You are soldiers of Gondor. No matter what comes through that gate you will stand your ground.
1206,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Volley! , Fire!"
1207,The Return of the King,SAM,"Let him go, you filth! Let him go!"
1208,The Return of the King,SAM,"You will not touch him again! , Come on then, finish it!"
1209,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Keep breathing. That's the key.Breathe.
1210,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,They've run as if the very whipsof their masters were behind them.
1211,The Two Towers,ORC,We're not going no further......until we've had a breather.
1212,The Two Towers,UGLUK,Get a fire going!
1213,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Merry!Merry!
1214,The Two Towers,MERRY,"I think we might have made a mistakeleaving the Shire, Pippin."
1215,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,What's making that noise?
1216,The Two Towers,MERRY,It's the trees.
1217,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Peregrin Took my lad, there is a task now to be done.  Another     opportunity for one of the Shire folk to prove their great worth.     , You must not fail me."
1218,The Return of the King,FARAMIR,It's been very quiet across the river.
1219,The Return of the King,MADRIL,"The Orcs are lying low.  The garrison may have moved out.  We've sent     scouts to Cair Andros.  If the Orcs attack from the North, we'll have some     warning."
1220,The Return of the King,GOTHMOG,Quiet.
1221,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,We need 10 more.
1222,The Return of the King,EOWYN,No.
1223,The Return of the King,THEODEN,"I go to my fathers, in whose mighty company; I shall not now feel ashamed."
1224,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Eowyn.
1225,The Return of the King,KING OF THE DEAD,Release us!
1226,The Return of the King,GIMLI,"Bad idea!  Very handy in a tight spot these lads, despite the fact they're dead."
1227,The Return of the King,KING OF THE DEAD,You gave us your word!
1228,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,I hold your oath fulfilled.  Go.  Be at peace.

1232,The Two Towers,FRODO,"Lead the way, Smeagol."
1233,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Good Smeagol always helps.
1234,The Two Towers,MERRY,Hello?Treebeard?Where has he gone?
1235,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,I had the loveliest dream last night.There was this large barrelfull of pipe-weed.And we smoked all of it.And then......you were sick.I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
1236,The Two Towers,MERRY,Did you hear that?There it is again.Something's not right here.Not right at all.
1237,The Two Towers,MERRY,You just said something...Treeish.
1238,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"No, I didn't. I was just stretching."
1239,The Two Towers,MERRY,You're taller.
1240,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Who?
1241,The Two Towers,MERRY,You!
1242,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Than what?
1243,The Two Towers,MERRY,Than me!
1244,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,I've always been taller than you.
1245,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.You're the short one."
1246,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"Please, Merry.You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7"". ,3'8""!"
1247,The Return of the King,SHAGRAT,"It's going to the Great Eye, along with everything else."
1248,The Return of the King,GORBAG,I don't take orders from stinking Morgul-rats!
1249,The Return of the King,SHAGRAT,You touch it and I'll stick this blade in your gut!
1250,The Return of the King,GORBAG,The scum tried to knife me.  Kill him!
1251,The Return of the King,SAM,That's for Frodo!
1252,The Return of the King,SAM,And the Shire!
1253,The Return of the King,SAM,And that's for my old gaffer!
1254,The Return of the King,SHAGRAT,Stop your squealing you dunghill rat!
1255,The Return of the King,SHAGRAT,I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig!
1256,The Return of the King,SAM,Not if I stick you first!
1257,The Return of the King,FRODO,Sam!
1258,The Return of the King,FRODO,"Oh Sam, I'm so sorry.  Sorry for everything."
1259,The Return of the King,SAM,Let's get you out of here.
1260,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Rohan.Home of the Horse-lords.There's something strange at work here.Some evil gives speedto these creatures.Sets its will against us.
1261,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?
1262,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,The Uruks turn northeast.They are taking the Hobbits to lsengard.
1263,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Saruman.
1264,The Two Towers,SARUMAN VOICE OVER,The world is changing.Who now has the strength to standagainst the armies of Isengard......and Mordor?To stand against the might of Sauronand Saruman......and the union of the two towers?
1265,The Two Towers,SARUMAN VOICE OVER,"Together, my Lord Sauron...... we shall rule this Middle-earth."

1362,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Frodo has passed beyond my sight. ,  The darkness is deepening."
1363,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,If Sauron had the Ring we would know it.
1364,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"It's only a matter of time.  He has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping."
1365,The Return of the King,GIMLI,Let him stay there!  Let him rot!  Why should we care?
1366,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Because 10,000 Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom."

1373,The Two Towers,WILDMAN,Murderers!

1390,The Two Towers,FRODO,Who are you?
1391,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Mustn't ask us. Not its business.Gollum. Gollum.
1392,The Return of the King,SAM,It must be getting near teatime. Leastways it would be in decent places     where there is still teatime.
1393,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,We're not in decent places.
1394,The Return of the King,SAM,Mr Frodo?  What is it?
1395,The Return of the King,FRODO,It's just a feeling.  I don't think I'll be coming back.
1396,The Return of the King,SAM,Yes you will.  Of course you will.  That's just morbid thinking.  We're     going there and back again just like Mr Bilbo.  You'll see.
1397,The Return of the King,FRODO,I think these lands were once part of the Kingdom of Gondor.
1398,The Return of the King,FRODO,"Long ago, when there was a King."
1399,The Return of the King,SAM,"Mr Frodo, look!  The King has got a crown again."

1413,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,"Well!  Here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily! I     have the eyes of a hawk, and ears of a fox!"
1414,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,Oh!

1421,The Two Towers,FRODO,We can't leave this here for someoneto follow us down.
1422,The Two Towers,SAM,"Who's gonna follow us down hereMr. Frodo?It's a shame, really.Lady Galadriel gave me that.Real Elvish rope.    Well, there's nothing for it.It's one of my knots.Won't come free in a hurry."

1424,The Two Towers,SAM,"Mordor. The one place in Middle-earthwe don't want to see any closer.And it's the one placewe're trying to get to.It's just where we can't get.    Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.I don't think Gandalf meant for us tocome this way."
1425,The Two Towers,FRODO,"He didn't mean for a lot of thingsto happen, Sam......but they did."
1426,The Two Towers,SAM,"Mr. Frodo?It's the Ring, isn't it?"
1427,The Two Towers,FRODO,It's getting heavier.

1451,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"Gandalf! , Where's     Gandalf? , GANDALF!"
1452,The Two Towers,SNAGA,Just a mouthful......a bit of the flank.
1453,The Two Towers,UGLUK,Looks like meat's back on the menuboys.
1454,The Two Towers,MERRY,Pippin.Let's go.
1455,The Two Towers,GRISHNAKH,Go on.Call for help. Squeal.No one's going to save you now.
1456,The Two Towers,MERRY,Pippin!
1457,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Aaaaaaaagh!
1458,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,A red sun rises.Blood has been spilled this night.
1459,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Riders of Rohan......what news from the Mark?
1460,The Two Towers,EOMER,"What business does an Elf, a Manand a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?Speak quickly!"
1461,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"Give me your name, horse-masterand I shall give you mine."
1462,The Two Towers,EOMER,"I would cut off your head, Dwarf......if it stood but a little higherfrom the ground."
1463,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,You would die before your stroke fell.
1464,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,"I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.This is Gimli, son of Gloinand Legolas of the Woodland Realm.We are friends of Rohanand of Theoden, your king."
1465,The Two Towers,EOMER,"Theoden no longer recognizesfriend from foe. Not even his own kin. ,Saruman has poisoned the mindof the king......and claimed lordship over these lands.    My company are those loyal to Rohan.And for that, we are banished.The White Wizard is cunning.He walks here and there, they say......as an old man hooded and cloaked.And everywhere, his spiesslip past our nets."
1466,The Return of the King,SOLDIER,Very good sir.
1467,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Gamling.
1468,The Return of the King,GAMLING,My lord!
1469,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Make haste across the Riddermark.  Summon every able-bodied man to     Dunharrow.
1470,The Return of the King,GAMLING,I will.
1471,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Do you ride with us?
1472,The Return of the King,EOWYN,"Just to the encampment.  It's tradition for the women of the court to     farewell the men.  ,         The men have found their captain.  They will follow you into battle.  Even     to death.  You have given us hope."
1473,The Return of the King,MERRY,"Excuse me!  , I have     a sword.  Please accept it!  , I offer you my service Theoden King."
1474,The Return of the King,THEODEN,"And gladly, I accept it.  ,      You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan."
1475,The Return of the King,GIMLI,"Horse men!  I wish I could muster an army of Dwarves, fully armed and     filthy."
1476,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war.  I fear war already     marches on their own lands.
1477,The Return of the King,THEODEN,
1478,The Return of the King,EOMER,"Now is the hour,     Riders of Rohan.  Oaths you have taken.  Now fulfil them all, to Lord and     Land!  Hah!"
1479,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Why are there so few of youwhen you have lived so long? Are there Ent children?
1480,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,Bru-ra-hroom.There have been no Entingsfor a terrible long count of years.
1481,The Two Towers,MERRY,Why is that?
1482,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,We lost the Entwives.
1483,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,"Oh, I'm sorry. How did they die?"
1484,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,Die? No.We lost them.And now we cannot find them. I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
1485,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Can't say that I have. You, Pip?"
1486,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,What do they     look like?
1487,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,I don't remember now.
1488,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. There dwells Theoden,     King of Rohan...... whose mind is overthrown. Saruman's hold over King     Theoden is now very strong."
1489,The Two Towers,EOWYN,"My lord, your son......he is dead. , My lord? Uncle? Will you not go to him? Will you do     nothing?"
1490,The Two Towers,GANDALF,Be careful what you say.Do not look for welcome here.
1491,The Two Towers,GRIMA,"Oh, he must have died sometime in the night. What a tragedy     for the king......to lose his only son and heir."
1492,The Return of the King,GANDALF,I've sent him to his death.
1493,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,No.  There is still hope for Frodo.  He needs time and safe passage across the plains of    Gorgoroth.  We can give him that.
1494,The Return of the King,GIMLI,How?
1495,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Draw out Sauron's armies.  Empty his lands.   Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate.
1496,The Return of the King,EOMER,We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.
1497,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Not for ourselves.  But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's eye fixed upon us.   Keep him blind to all else that moves.
1498,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,A diversion.
1499,The Return of the King,GIMLI,"Certainty of death, small chance of success, what are we waiting for?"
1500,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Sauron will suspect a trap.  He will not take the bait.
1501,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"Oh, I think he will."
1502,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,"Long have you hunted me.  Long have I eluded you.  No more! ,  Behold, the Sword of Elendil!"
1503,The Two Towers,EOTHAIN,"Yes, Mama."
1504,The Two Towers,FREDA,"I don't want to leave.I don't want to go, Mama."
1505,The Two Towers,MORWEN,"Freda, I will find     you there."
1506,The Two Towers,MORWEN,"Quickly! ,Go, child."
1507,The Two Towers,SARUMAN VOICE OVER,"Rohan, my lord......is ready to fall."
1508,The Two Towers,EOMER,Theodred.Find the king's son!
1509,The Two Towers,ROHAN HORSEMAN,Mordor will pay for this
1510,The Two Towers,EOMER,These Orcs are not from Mordor.
1511,The Two Towers,ROHAN HORSEMAN,"My Lord Eomer, over here!"
1512,The Two Towers,EOMER,He's alive.
1513,The Two Towers,EOWYN,Theodred.
1514,The Two Towers,EOWYN,"Your son is badly wounded, my lord."
1515,The Two Towers,EOMER,He was ambushed by Orcs.If we don't defend our countrySaruman will take it by force
1516,The Two Towers,GRIMA,That is a lie.Saruman the White has ever beenour friend and ally.
1517,The Two Towers,FRODO,Gandalf told me you wereone of the river-folk.
1518,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Cold be heart and hand and boneCold be travellers far from home
1519,The Two Towers,FRODO,He said your life was a sad story.
1520,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,They do not see what lies aheadWhen sun has failed and moon is dead
1521,The Two Towers,FRODO,You were not so very differentfrom a Hobbit once.Were you?Smeagol.

1533,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Come on, Hobbits!  Mustn't stop now.   This way!"
1534,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.  ,  I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any     fighting,   do they?"
1535,The Return of the King,GANDALF,You're in the service of the steward now.  You'll have to do as you are     told Peregrin Took.
1536,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Ridiculous Hobbit!  Guard of the Citadel!

1539,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Yes.
1540,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,It's so quiet.
1541,The Return of the King,GANDALF,It's the deep breath before the plunge.
1542,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"I don't want to be in a battle.  But waiting on the edge of one I can't     escape is even worse. , Is     there any hope Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?"
1543,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"There never was much hope.  Just a fool's hope.  , Our enemy is ready.      His full strength's gathered.   Not only orcs, but men as well    ,  Legions of Haradrim from     the South, mercenaries from the coast ,     All will answer Mordor's call."

1579,The Two Towers,FRODO,It's because we've been here before.We're going in circles.
1580,The Two Towers,SAM,What is that horrid stink?I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it?
1581,The Two Towers,FRODO,Yes.....I can smell it.................We're not alone.

1588,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,No!That would kill us! Kill us!
1589,The Two Towers,SAM,It's no more than you deserve!
1590,The Two Towers,FRODO,"Maybe he does deserve to die.But now that I see him, I do pity him."
1591,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,We be nice to themif they be nice to us.Take it off us.We swears to do what you wants................We swears.
1592,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,"Mr Frodo ? , Frodo! Frodo!     , I thought I'd lost you"
1593,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,What are you talking about ?
1594,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,It's just something Gandalf said.
1595,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,What did he say?
1596,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,The Fellowship awaits the Ringbearer.
1597,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,"Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right ?"

1599,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF VOICEOVER,"We must hold this course west of the Misty Mountains for     forty days. If our luck holds the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us.    , and there are     road turns east to Mordor."

1604,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,"If     anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note that they're not, I'd say     that we were taking the long way round. Gandalf, we could pass through the     Mines of Moria.  My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome."
1605,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"No Gimli, I would not take the road through Moria unless I     had no other choice."
1606,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,ARGH!

1618,The Fellowship of the Ring,ARWEN,I choose a mortal life
1619,The Fellowship of the Ring,ARAGORN,You cannot give me this
1620,The Fellowship of the Ring,ARWEN,It is mine to give to whom I will.  Like my heart

1624,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,We are no spies.We track a party of Uruk-haiwestward across the plain.They have taken two of our friendscaptive.
1625,The Two Towers,EOMER,The Uruks are destroyed.We slaughtered them during the night.
1626,The Two Towers,GIMLI,But there were two Hobbits.Did you see two Hobbits with them?
1627,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,They would be small.Only children to your eyes.
1628,The Two Towers,EOMER,We left none alive.We piled the carcasses and burned them.
1629,The Two Towers,GIMLI,Dead?
1630,The Two Towers,EOMER,I am sorry.

1633,The Two Towers,GIMLI,It's one of their wee belts.
1634,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,Hiro hyn h'dh'     ab 'wanath...
1635,The Two Towers,ARAGORN,Aaaaagh!
1636,The Two Towers,GRIMA,I understand. His passing is hard to accept. Especially now     that your brother has deserted you.
1637,The Two Towers,EOWYN,"Leave me alone, snake!"
1638,The Two Towers,GRIMA,"Oh, but you are alone. Who knows what you've spoken to the     darkness ,......in     the bitter watches of the night......when all your life seems to shrink. The     walls of your bower closing in about you. A hutch to trammel some wild thing     in.    ,So fair. So cold. Like a morning of pale spring......still clinging     to winter's chill."
1639,The Two Towers,EOWYN,Your words are poison.
1640,The Two Towers,GIMLI,You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
1641,The Two Towers,HAMA,"I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf     Greyhame. By order of Grima Wormtongue."
1642,The Two Towers,HAMA,Your staff
1643,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"Hmmm ,You     would not part an old man from his walking stick."
1644,The Two Towers,GRIMA,"My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. He's a herald of woe."
1645,The Two Towers,GANDALF,The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late......Theoden     King.
1646,The Two Towers,GRIMA,He's     not welcome.
1647,The Two Towers,THEODEN,Why should I welcome you......Gandalf Stormcrow?
1648,The Two Towers,GRIMA,"A just question, my liege. ,Late is the hour......in which this     conjurer chooses to appear., Lathspell I name him.Ill news is an ill guest."
1649,The Two Towers,GANDALF,Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. I have     not passed through fire and death......to bandy crooked words with a witless     worm.
1650,The Two Towers,GRIMA,His staff. I     told you to take the wizard's staff.
1651,The Two Towers,THEODEN,"Grima.Grima.,Grima."

1653,The Two Towers,GRIMA,Why do you lay these troubleson an already troubled mind?Can you not see?Your uncle is weariedby your malcontent......your warmongering.
1654,The Two Towers,EOMER,"Warmongering?,How long is it sinceSaruman bought you?What was the promised price, Grima?When all the Men are deadyou will take your share of the treasure?"
1655,The Two Towers,EOMER,Too long have you watched my sister.Too long have you haunted her steps.
1656,The Two Towers,GRIMA,"You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund."
1657,The Two Towers,GRIMA,Too much.You are banished forthwithfrom the kingdom of Rohan......and all its domainsunder pain of death.
1658,The Two Towers,EOMER,You have no authority here.Your orders mean nothing.
1659,The Two Towers,GRIMA,This order does not come from me.It comes from the king.He signed it this morning.
1660,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,"Dead?No, you cannot kill them. No."
1661,The Two Towers,GOLLUM,Wraiths!Wraiths on wings!They are calling for it.They are calling for the precious.
1662,The Two Towers,SAM,Mr. Frodo! It's all right.I'm here.

1674,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"This will be the end of Gondor as we know it.    Here the hammer stroke     will fall hardest.  ,  If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath     falls, the last defence of this city will be gone."
1675,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,But we have the white wizard.  That's got to count for something.
1676,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Gandalf?
1677,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Sauron has yet to show his deadliest servant.     ,      The one who will lead Mordor's army in war.  , The one they say no living man can kill.    ,     The Witch King of Angmar.

1722,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"and the Ring ? , You feel its power growing don't you. I've felt it     too.  You must be careful now.  Evil will be drawn to you from     outside the Fellowship and I fear from within."
1723,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Who then do I trust ?
1724,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,You must trust to yourself. Trust your own strength.
1725,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,What do you mean ?
1726,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,There are many powers in this world for good or for evil.      Some are greater than I am and against some I have not yet been tested

1728,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,Dwarf doors are invisible when closed

1732,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"It reads ""The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria, Speak Friend     and Enter"""
1733,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,What do you suppose that means ?

2004,The Return of the King,ARWEN,"If I leave him now, I will regret it forever. It is time."
2005,The Return of the King,ARWEN,"From the ashes of fire shall be woken,     A light from the shadow shall spring,     Renewed shall be blade that was broken,         The crownless again shall be king."
2006,The Return of the King,ARWEN,Reforge the sword' ada.
2007,The Return of the King,ELROND,Your hands are cold. The life of the Eldar is leaving you.
2008,The Return of the King,ARWEN,"This was my choice. Ada, whether by your will or not there is no ship     now that can bear me hence."
2009,The Return of the King,GANDALF,We have just passed into the realm of Gondor.
2010,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Minas Tirith. City of Kings.
2011,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"It's the tree! Gandalf, Gandalf."
2012,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Yes the white tree of Gondor. The tree of the King. Lord Denethor     however, is not the King. He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne."
2013,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Now listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir's father. To give him     news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise. And do not mention     Frodo or the Ring. And say nothing of Aragorn either. In fact, its better if     you don't speak at all Peregrin Took."
2014,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Hail Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor."
2015,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,A Ring!
2016,The Fellowship of the Ring,GOLLUM,"Lost!    , My Precious is lost."
2017,The Fellowship of the Ring,GALADRIEL,For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the     fortunes of all.
2018,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"The 22nd day of September in the year 1400    ,by Shire     reckoning. , Bag End,     Bagshot Row, Hobbiton, West Farthing, The Shire, Middle Earth.    , The Third Age of this world."
2019,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"There and back again, A Hobbit's tale, by Bilbo     Baggins. ,Now, where to begin?     Ah, yes. ,Concerning Hobbits."
2020,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO VOICEOVER,"Hobbits have been living and farming in the four     Farthings of the Shire for many hundreds of years. , quite content to     ignore and be ignored by the world of the Big Folk. , Middle Earth being,     after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Hobbits must seem of     little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted     amongst the very wise."
2021,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Frodo, someone at     the door. ,In fact, it     has been remarked by some that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.    , A rather unfair observation    , As     we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales    ,and the smoking of pipeweed. , But where     our hearts truly lie , is in peace and quiet ,and good     tilled earth. ,For all Hobbits share a love of all things that grow.    ,And yes, no doubt to others, our ways seem quaint    , But today of all days, it is brought home to me it is     no bad thing to celebrate a simple life."
2022,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Frodo, the door! ,     sticklebacks, where is that boy! FRODO!"
2023,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"Hmm hmm hmm hmm, Down from the door where it began, hmm     hmm hmm hmm"
2024,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"And I must follow if I can. , The road goes     ever on and on, down from the door where it began, now far ahead the road     has gone, and I must follow if I can."

2029,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,No news of Frodo?
2030,The Return of the King,GANDALF,No word. Nothing.
2031,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,We have time. Every day Frodo moves closer to Mordor.
2032,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Do we know that?
2033,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,What does your     heart tell you?
2034,The Return of the King,GANDALF,That Frodo is alive.     Yes' yes he's alive.
2035,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Too risky. Too risky. ,Thieves. They stole it from us. Kill them, kill them, kill them both!    ,"
2036,The Return of the King,SMEAGOL,No!
2037,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Sshh, quiet, mustn't wake them. Mustn't ruin it now."
2038,The Return of the King,SMEAGOL,"But they knows, ,     they knows, they suspects us!"
2039,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"What's it saying my precious, my love? Is Smeagol losing his nerve?"
2040,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,"Soon Mr Elf, you will enjoy the fabelled hospitality of the     dwarves. Roaring fires! Malt Beer! Red Meat off the bone!"
2041,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,This my friend is the home of my cousin Balin and they call     it a Mine!
2042,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,A Mine!
2043,The Fellowship of the Ring,BOROMIR,"This isn't     a mine, it's a tomb"
2044,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,Nooooo!     NOOOOOOOOOOoooooooo!
2045,The Fellowship of the Ring,LEGOLAS,Goblins!
2046,The Fellowship of the Ring,BOROMIR,We make for the gap of Rohan.  We should never have     come here
2047,The Fellowship of the Ring,BOROMIR,Now get out of here! Get out!

2049,The Two Towers,MERRY,"Hello, Pip."
2050,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,You're hurt.
2051,The Two Towers,MERRY,I'm fine. lt was just an act.
2052,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,An act?
2053,The Two Towers,MERRY,"See? I fooled you too.Don't worry about me, Pippin."
2054,The Two Towers,UGLUK,What is it? What do you smell?
2055,The Two Towers,URUK HAI,Man-flesh

2057,The Two Towers,PIPPIN,Aragorn.
2058,The Two Towers,UGLUK,Let's move!
2059,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,That black rider was looking for something. Or someone (he     walks up to Frodo and looks him in the face) Frodo ?
2060,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,Get down!
2061,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,"I have to leave the Shire. ,Sam and I must get to Bree"
2062,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,Right. Bucklebury     Ferry.  Follow me.

2072,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Let the Ringbearer decide
2073,The Fellowship of the Ring,BOROMIR,"We cannot stay here! ,This will be the death of the     hobbits!"
2074,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Frodo ?
2075,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,We will go through     the Mines
2076,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,So be it
2077,The Two Towers,GIMLI,"Strong?! ,Oh, that's good."
2078,The Two Towers,GANDALF,"So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.Merry and Pippin are quite safe.In fact, they are far saferthan you are about to be."
2079,The Two Towers,GIMLI,This new Gandalf's more grumpythan the old one.
2080,The Two Towers,LEGOLAS,That is one of the Mearas......unless my eyes are cheatedby some spell.
2081,The Two Towers,GANDALF,Shadowfax.He is the lord of all horses......and has been my friendthrough many dangers.
2082,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,
2083,The Two Towers,MERRY,ls it much further?
2084,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.You might call it far, perhaps.My home lies deep in the forest......near the roots of the mountain.I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.And safe is where I'll keep you.I believe you will enjoy this next one too. ,It's one of my own compositions.Right."
2085,The Two Towers,TREEBEARD,"Sleep, little Shirelings.Heed no nightly noise.Sleep till morning light.I have business in the forest.There are many to call.Many that must come. ,The Shadow lies on Fangorn.The withering of all woodsis drawing near."
2086,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Mordor!
2087,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,In the common tongue it says
2088,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,Done!
2089,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,You're supposed to stick it in the ground
2090,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,It is in the ground
2091,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,Outside
2092,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,It was your idea!
2093,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Bilbo! Bilbo!  Watch out for the dragon
2094,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Dragon! Nonsense, there hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand     years."
2095,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,That was good!
2096,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,Lets get another one!
2097,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took! I might have known!
2098,The Fellowship of the Ring,CROWD,Speech Bilbo
2099,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Speech!
2100,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"My dear Bagginses and Boffins, , Tooks and Brandybucks ,, Grubbs ,, Chubbs    ,, Hornblowers ,, Bulgers ,,     Bracegirdles ,, and Proudfoots"
2101,The Fellowship of the Ring,PROUDFOOT HOBBIT,PROUDFEET!
2102,The Return of the King,GANDALF,I come with tidings in this dark hour and with counsel.
2103,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,Perhaps you come to explain this.
2104,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,Perhaps you have come to tell me why my son is dead.
2105,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Boromir died to save us my kinsman and me. He fell defending us from     many foes.
2106,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Pippin.
2107,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"I offer you my service, such as it is in payment of this debt."
2108,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,This is my first command to you. How did you escape and my son did not?     So mighty as man as he was.
2109,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow and Boromir was pierced by     many.
2110,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Get up!
2111,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir but it is not now.     War is coming. The enemy is on your doorstep. As steward, you are charged     with the defence of this city. Where are Gondor's armies? You still have     friends. You are not alone in this fight. Send word to Theoden of Rohan.     Light the beacons."
2112,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,"You think you are wise Mithrandir. Yet for all your subtleties you have     not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen     more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against     Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me. I know who rides     with Theoden of Rohan. Oh yes, word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son     of Arathorn. And I tell you now. I will not bow to this Ranger from the     North. Last of a ragged house long bereft of Lordship."
2113,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King, steward."
2114,The Return of the King,DENETHOR,The rule of Gondor is mine and no others!
2115,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Come!
2116,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"All had turned to vain ambition. He would use even his grief as a cloak!     A thousand years this city has stood and now at the whim of a madman it will     fall! And the white tree, the tree of the King will never bloom again."
2117,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"A wizard is never late! Frodo Baggins.    , Nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means     to."
2118,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Its wonderful to see you Gandalf.
2119,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,You didn't think Id miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?
2120,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,So how is the old rascal? I hear it is going to be a     party of special significance?
2121,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,You know Bilbo he's got the whole place in an uproar.
2122,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Well that should please him.
2123,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Half the Shire's been invited.     And the rest of them are turning up anyway.
2124,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO VOICEOVER,"And so life in the Shire goes on, very much as it has     this past age. , Full of its own comings and goings with change coming     slowly, if it comes at all. ,For things are made to endure in     the Shire, passing from one generation to the next. There's always been a     Baggins living here under the Hill, in Bag End"
2125,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,And there always will be.
2126,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,"To tell you the truth, Bilbo has been acting a bit odd     lately. ,I     mean, more than usual. He's taken to locking himself in his study.    , He spends hours     and hours poring over old maps when he thinks I'm not looking."
2127,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,Where's it gone?
2128,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,Aaaaah.
2129,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,"He's up to something. , All right then,     keep your secrets!"
2130,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,What?
2131,The Return of the King,SMEAGOL,No! No! Never! Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses. Smeagol wants to see them'. Dead!
2132,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"And we will! Smeagol did it once, he can do it again!     ,     Its ours! Ours!"
2133,The Return of the King,SMEAGOL,We must get the precious! We must get it back!
2134,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,Patience! Patience my love! First we must lead them to her!
2135,The Return of the King,SMEAGOL,We lead them to the winding stair.
2136,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Yes, the stairs and then?"
2137,The Return of the King,SMEAGOL,"Up, up, up the stairs we go until we come to the tunnel."
2138,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"And when they go in, there's no coming out. She's always hungry. She     always needs to' feed. She must eat. All she gets is filthy Orcses."
2139,The Return of the King,SMEAGOL,"And they doesn't taste very nice, does they Precious?"
2140,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"No, not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats.    ,     Hobbit meat. And when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes     , then we will find it."
2141,The Return of the King,SMEAGOL,And take it for Meee!
2142,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,For us.
2143,The Return of the King,SMEAGOL,"Yes, we meant for us! Gollum, gollum. The precious will be ours once the Hobbitses are dead!"
2144,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY AND PIPPIN,Frodo! Frodo!
2145,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,"Strider! , Get off him!"
2146,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,Aragorn!
2147,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,Frodo!
2148,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Strider!
2149,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Into the Mines!
2150,The Fellowship of the Ring,BOROMIR,Legolas!
2151,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"We now have but one choice, we must face the long dark of     Moria.  Be on your guard, there are older and fouler things than orcs     in the deep places of the world"
2152,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"The wealth of Moria is not in gold, or jewels, but Mithril"
2153,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him
2154,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,Aww that was a Kingly gift
2155,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"Yes.  I never told him, but its worth was greater than     the value of The Shire!"
2156,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,Pippin!
2157,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,I've no memory of this place
2158,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,Are we lost ?
2159,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,Frodo! Come on!
2160,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,Frodo!
2161,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,Come on faster!
2162,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,How far to the nearest crossing ?
2163,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,"The Brandywine Bridge, twenty miles."
2164,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Come on!
2165,The Fellowship of the Ring,GATEKEEPER,What do you want ?
2166,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,We're heading for the Prancing Pony.
2167,The Fellowship of the Ring,GATEKEEPR,Hobbits! Four hobbits!  What's more out of     The Shire by your talk!  What business brings you to Bree?
2168,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,We wish to at the Inn.  Our business is our own.
2169,The Fellowship of the Ring,GATEKEEPER,"alright young sir, I     meant no offence. ,My job to ask questions after nightfall. There's talk of strange folk     abroad. Can't be too careful"
2170,The Fellowship of the Ring,MAN,Out of the way! Watch where you're walking!
2171,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Excuse me ?
2172,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,Today is my One Hundred and Eleventh birthday!
2173,The Fellowship of the Ring,HOBBIT,Happy Birthday!
2174,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Alas, elevnty-one years is far too short a time to live     among such excellent and admirable hobbits.,  I don't know half of you half as well as I     should like and I like less than half of you, half as well as you deserve."
2175,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Why are they still guarding it?
2176,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one     day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once     was before it fell into decay. ,     The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken. Kings made tombs more     splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their     descent , dearer than the names of their sons.    ,     Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers     asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.    ,     The line of Kings failed. The white tree withered. The rule of Gondor was     given over to lesser men."
2177,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Mordor.
2178,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Yes, there it lies. This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow."
2179,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,A storm is coming.
2180,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"This is not the weather of the world. This is a device of Sauron's     making. A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have     no love of daylight, so he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage     along the road to war. When the shadow of Mordor reaches this city it will     begin."
2181,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"Well' Minas Tirith' very impressive. ,So where are off to next?"
2182,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Oh, it's too late for that Peregrin. There's no leaving this city.    ,     Help must come to us."
2183,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,But I know you have something to do with it.
2184,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Good gracious me!
2185,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Before you came along we Bagginses were very well     thought of.
2186,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Indeed?
2187,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,"We never had any adventures, or did anything     unexpected."
2188,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I     was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the     door."
2189,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,"Whatever you did, you've been officially labelled as a     'disturber of the peace.'"
2190,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Oh really?
2191,The Fellowship of the Ring,CHILDREN HOBBITS,Gandalf! Gandalf!
2192,The Fellowship of the Ring,CHILDREN HOBBITS,Fireworks Gandalf! Gandalf! Fireworks Gandalf!
2193,The Fellowship of the Ring,CHILDREN HOBBITS,Hooooraaaay!
2194,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,"Gandalf, I'm glad you're back."
2195,The Return of the King,SAM,You treacherous little toad!
2196,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"No, no! Master!"
2197,The Return of the King,FRODO,No Sam! Leave him alone!
2198,The Return of the King,SAM,I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us.
2199,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,"Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly! ,     Aaaagh he is a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol and who makes up nasty lies!"
2200,The Return of the King,SAM,You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!
2201,The Return of the King,FRODO,Sam!
2202,The Return of the King,SAM,Call me a liar? You're a liar!
2203,The Return of the King,GOLLUM,Waaaah!
2204,The Return of the King,FRODO,If you scare him off then we are lost!
2205,The Return of the King,SAM,I don't care! I can't do it Mr Frodo! I won't wait around for him to     kill us!
2206,The Return of the King,FRODO,I'm not sending him away.
2207,The Return of the King,SAM,You don't see it do you? He's a villain.
2208,The Return of the King,FRODO,We can't do this by ourselves Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my     side.
2209,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,No
2210,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,I think we are
2211,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,Ssh! Gandalf's thinking
2212,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,Merry!
2213,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,What!
2214,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,I'm hungry
2215,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,There's something down there
2216,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,It's Gollum
2217,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Gollum!
2218,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,He's been following us for three days
2219,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,He escaped the dungeons of Barad-D'r!
2220,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"Escaped ,     or was set loose and now the Ring has drawn him here ,      He won't ever be rid of his need for it.  He hates and loves the Ring,     as he hates and loves himself.  Smeagol's life is a sad story    ,  Yes    , he was once called, before the Ring     found him. Before it drove him mad"
2221,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,It's a pity Bilbo didnt kill him when he had the chance
2222,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"Pity ?  It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.      Many that live deserve death and many that die, deserve life. Can you give     it to them Frodo ? Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgement Even     the very wise cannot see all ends.  My heart tells me that Gollum has     some part to play, yet for good or ill.... before this is over.     ,     The pity of Bilbo, may rule the fate of many"
2223,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,I wish the Ring had never come to me.  I wish none of     this had happened.
2224,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for     them to decide.  All we have to decide is what to do with the time that     is given to us.  There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo,     besides the will of evil.  Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which     case you also were meant to have it and that is an encouraging thought.        Oh! Its that way"
2225,The Fellowship of the Ring,BARLIMAN,"Good Evening little masters.  What can I do for you ?     If you're looking for accomodation, we've got some nice, cosy hobbit sized     rooms available.  Always proud to cater to the little folk, Mr err... ?"
2226,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,"Underhill, my name's     Underhill"
2227,The Fellowship of the Ring,BARLIMAN,"Underhill , yes.."
2228,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,We're friends of Gandalf the Grey. Can you tell him we've     arrived?
2229,The Fellowship of the Ring,BARLIMAN,"Gandalf ?  ,Gandalf ? Oh yes!  I remember!  Elderly chap! Big grey     beard, pointy hat.  , Not seen     him for six months."
2230,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,What do we do now ?
2231,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Sam. He'll be here.  He'll come.
2232,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,What's that ?
2233,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,"This my friend, is a pint!"
2234,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,It comes in pints ?
2235,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,hmmmhmmm
2236,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,I'm getting one!
2237,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,You've had a whole half already!
2238,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we     arrived!
2239,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"So am I dear boy. , So am I."
2240,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"No thank     you! We don't want any more visitors, well wishers or distant relations!"
2241,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,And what about very old friends?
2242,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,Gandalf?
2243,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Bilbo Baggins.
2244,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,My dear Gandalf!
2245,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"It's good to see you. One hundred and eleven years old     who would believe it. ,     You haven't aged a day!"
2246,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome. Oh, here we are."
2247,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Tea or maybe something a little stronger? I've got a     few bottles of the Old Winyard left, 1296, a very good year, almost as old     as I am."
2248,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"It was laid down by my father, what say we open one eh?"
2249,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"Just tea, thank you."
2250,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Owwwh!
2251,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,I was expecting you sometime last week. Not that it     matters; you come and go as you please. Always have done and always will.
2252,The Return of the King,SAM,I'm on your side Mr Frodo
2253,The Return of the King,FRODO,"I know Sam, I know. Trust me. Come Smeagol."
2254,The Return of the King,EOWYN,What time is it?
2255,The Return of the King,EOWYN,"I dreamed I saw a great wave climbing over green lands and above the     hills. I stood upon the brink. It was utterly dark in the abyss before my     feet. A light shone behind me but I could not turn ,     I could only stand there, waiting."
2256,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Night changes many thoughts. Sleep Eowyn. Sleep while you can.
2257,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,"The stars are veiled. Something stirs in the East, a sleepless malice , The eye of the enemy     is moving."
2258,The Return of the King,MERRY,What are you doing?
2259,The Return of the King,MERRY,Pippin!
2260,The Return of the King,MERRY,Pippin!
2261,The Return of the King,MERRY,Pippin! Are you mad?
2262,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"I just want to look at it, just one more time."
2263,The Return of the King,MERRY,Put it back!
2264,The Return of the King,MERRY,Pippin!
2265,The Return of the King,MERRY,No!
2266,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,He's remembered
2267,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"No, but the air doesnt smell so foul down here.  If in doubt, Meriadoc,     always follow your nose."
2268,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"Let me risk a little more light , Behold the     great realm and dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf."
2269,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,There's an eye-opener and no mistake
2270,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,Oh!
2271,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Gimli!
2272,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,"No, no , no"
2273,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"Here lies Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of Moria.    ,  He is dead then.    ,  Its as I feared."
2274,The Fellowship of the Ring,LEGOLAS,"We must move on,     we cannot linger."
2275,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"They have taken the Bridge and the second hall.  We have barred the     gates, but cannot hold them for long.  The ground shakes.  Drums    ,     Drums in the deep. We cannot get out. , A shadow moves in the dark.    , We cannot get out. They are     coming."
2276,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"Fool of a     Took!  ,  Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your     stupidity!"
2277,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,Frodo!
2278,The Fellowship of the Ring,LEGOLAS,Orcs!
2279,The Fellowship of the Ring,ARAGORN,Get back! and     stay close to Gandalf.
2280,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Excuse me. That man in the corner.  Who is he ?
2281,The Fellowship of the Ring,BARLIMAN,"He's one of them rangers. They're dangerous folk they are.      Wandering the wilds.  What his right name is, I've never heard, but     round here, he's known as Strider."
2282,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Strider
2283,The Fellowship of the Ring,RING,Baggins.... Baggins.... Baggins ....Baggins!  Baggins!
2284,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,"Baggins ?  Sure I know a Baggins!  He's over     there.  Frodo Baggins! He's my second cousin once removed on his     mother's side , and my     third cousin twice removed on his father's side, if you follow me."
2285,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Pippin!
2286,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,Steady on!
2287,The Fellowship of the Ring,MEN,Oh!
2288,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAURON VOICE,"You cannot hide!  , I see you!    ,There     is no life in the void , Only death!"
2289,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,You draw far too much attention to yourself Mr Underhill!
2290,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,What do you want ?
2291,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,A little more caution from you!  That is no trinket     you carry!
2292,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,I carry nothing
2293,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,"Indeed , I can avoid being seen if I wish.      But to disappear entirely     That is a rare gift!"
2294,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"You've caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid urm we've     only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle oh and there's some cheese here,     oh no that wont do! Urm we've got raspberry jam, an apple tart    ,     but we've not much for afters. Oh no we're all right, I've found some sponge     cake! , I can make     you some eggs if you ' oh'. Gandalf?"
2295,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,"Just tea, thank you."
2296,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Oh right. ,     You don't mind if I do, do you?"
2297,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Oh not at all!
2298,The Fellowship of the Ring,VOICE,Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!
2299,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"I'm not at     home! , It's the Sackville-Bagginses."
2300,The Fellowship of the Ring,VOICE,I know you're in there!
2301,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"They're after the house! , They've never forgiven me for living this     long. I've got to get away from these confounded relatives hanging on the     bell all day, never giving me a moment's peace. , I want to see     mountains again, mountains Gandalf. , And     then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea!"
2302,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,So you mean to go through with your plan then?
2303,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Yes, yes, it's all in hand. All the arrangements are     made. , Oh, thank you."
2304,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,Frodo suspects something.
2305,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Of course he does, he's a Baggins, not some blockheaded     Bracegirdle from Hardbottle."
2306,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,You will tell him wont you?
2307,The Return of the King,MERRY,Pippin!
2308,The Return of the King,LEGOLAS,He is here!
2309,The Return of the King,SAURON,I see you!
2310,The Return of the King,MERRY,Pippin!
2311,The Return of the King,MERRY,Help! Gandalf help!
2312,The Return of the King,MERRY,Help him!
2313,The Return of the King,MERRY,Pippin!
2314,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Fool of a Took!
2315,The Return of the King,GANDALF,No.
2316,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Look at me.
2317,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"Gandalf, forgive me!"
2318,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Look at me! What did you see?
2319,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"A tree, there was a white tree in a courtyard of stone. It was dead.    ,The city was burning."
2320,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?
2321,The Fellowship of the Ring,BOROMIR,They have a cave troll!
2322,The Fellowship of the Ring,GIMLI,Agh!  Let them come There's one dwarf yet in Moria who     still draws breath.
2323,The Fellowship of the Ring,ARAGORN,Pull!
2324,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Who are you ?
2325,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,Are you frightened?
2326,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Yes
2327,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you.
2328,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,Let him     go!  Or I'll have you Longshanks!
2329,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,You have a     stout heart little hobbit! But that will not save you.  You can no     longer wait for the wizard Frodo. They're coming
2330,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,What are they ?
2331,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,"They were once men. Great Kings of Men.  The Sauron     the Deciever  gave to them nine rings of power. Blinded by their greed     they took them without question. One by one falling into darkness    ,Now they are slaves to his will. They are     the Nazg'l. Ringwraiths.  Neither living nor dead. At all times they     feel the presence of the Ring , Drawn to the power of the One    , They     will never stop hunting you."
2332,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,Where are you taking us ?
2333,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,Into the wild
2334,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf ?
2335,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,"I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer, but feel     fouler."
2336,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,He's foul enough
2337,The Fellowship of the Ring,FRODO,We have no choice but to trust him
2338,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Yes, yes."
2339,The Fellowship of the Ring,GANDALF,He's very fond of you.
2340,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"I know, he'd probably come with me if I asked him to. I     think in his heart Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the woods, the     fields and the little rivers. I am old Gandalf. I know I don't look it, but     I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. , I feel     thin, sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a     holiday, a very long holiday. And I don't expect that I shall return. In     fact, I mean not to."
2341,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Old Toby, the finest weed in the Southfarthing."
2342,The Fellowship of the Ring,BILBO,"Gandalf my old friend, this will be a night to     remember."
2343,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"I saw' I saw him! , I     could hear his voice in my head."
2344,The Return of the King,GANDALF,And what did you tell him? Speak!
2345,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,He asked me my name. I didn't answer. He hurt me!
2346,The Return of the King,GANDALF,What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?
2347,The Return of the King,GANDALF,There was no lie in Pippin's eyes. A fool but an honest fool he remains.
2348,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring. ,We've been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the Palantir a glimpse     of the enemy's plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith."
2349,The Return of the King,GAN DALF,"His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.    , He knows the Heir of     Elendil has come forth ,     Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still. Strength enough,     perhaps, to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples     of Middle Earth uniting under one banner. , He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground    , before he     sees a King return to the throne of men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit     Rohan must be ready for war."
2350,The Return of the King,THEODEN,Tell me! Why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to     ours? What do we owe Gondor?
2351,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,I will go!
2352,The Return of the King,GANDALF,No!
2353,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,They must be warned!
2354,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,But where     is he leading us ?
2355,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,To Rivendell Master Gamgee.  To the House of Elrond.
2356,The Fellowship of the Ring,SAM,D'you hear that!  Rivendell! We're going to see the     elves!
2357,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,Gentlemen! We do not stop 'til nightfall
2358,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,What about breakfast ?
2359,The Fellowship of the Ring,STRIDER,You've     already had it
2360,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,We've had one yes.  What about second breakfast ?
2361,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,Don't think he knows about second breakfast Pippin
2362,The Fellowship of the Ring,PIPPIN,"What about elvenses ? Luncheon, Afternoon Tea, Dinner ?     Supper!  He knows about them, doesnt he ?"
2363,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,I wouldn't count on it
2364,The Fellowship of the Ring,MERRY,Pippin!
2365,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"They will be. ,     You must come to Minas Tirith by another road. Follow the river. Look to the     black ships. ,     Understand this, things are now in motion that cannot be undone. I ride for     Minas Tirith , and I     wont be going alone."
2366,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Of all the Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst! Hurry! Hurry!"
2367,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Where are we going?
2368,The Return of the King,MERRY,Why did you look? Why do you always have to look?
2369,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"I don't know, I can't help it."
2370,The Return of the King,MERRY,You never can!
2371,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,I'm sorry alright? I won't do it again.
2372,The Return of the King,MERRY,Don't you understand? The enemy thinks you have the ring! He is going to     be looking for you Pip. They have to get you out of here.
2373,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"And you? You're coming with me? ,     Merry?"
2374,The Return of the King,MERRY,Come on!
2375,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,How far is Minas Tirith?
2376,The Return of the King,GANDALF,Three days ride as the Nazg'l flies. And you'd better hope we don't have     one of those on our tail.
2377,The Return of the King,MERRY,"Here, something for the road."
2378,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,The last of the Longbottom Leaf?
2379,The Return of the King,MERRY,I know you've run out. You smoke too much Pippin.
2380,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,"But, we'll see each other soon?"
2381,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Wont we?
2382,The Return of the King,MERRY,I don't know! I don't know whats going to happen.
2383,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Merry?
2384,The Return of the King,GANDALF,"Run, Shadowfax show us the meaning of haste."
2385,The Return of the King,PIPPIN,Merry!
2386,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,Merry!
2387,The Return of the King,MERRY,"He's always followed me everywhere I went since before we were tweens. I     would get him into the worst sort of trouble but I was always there to get     him out. Now he's gone. , Just     like Frodo and Sam."
2388,The Return of the King,ARAGORN,One thing I've learnt about Hobbits: They are a most hardy folk.
2389,The Return of the King,MERRY,Foolhardy maybe. He's a Took!
